Invenio v2.1.0 -- released 2015-06-16
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ docker:

  - Disables debug mode when using standard Docker image. Uses docker
    compose to set the variable instead.

Incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ access:

  - Removes proprietary authentication protocol for robotlogin.
    (#2972)

    syntax has been changed from custom "bfo" to "yml". (#2662)

  - Custom output formats from the database needs to by merged with
    `bfo` files to new `yml` files. Please follow instructions when
    running `python scripts/output_format_migration_kit.py`.

+ global:

  - Removes old URL handlers for `/search` and `/record`.  (#2958)

  - Enables 'sql_mode' as 'ansi_quotes' for quotes compatibility for
    MySQL.

    capabilities.

  - Adds possibility to refer to documents and legacy BibDocFiles via
    special path such as `/api/multimedia/image/recid:{recid}` or

    functions are specified in the 'SEARCH_QUERY_ENHANCERS' and later
    they are applied to the query AST one after the other in the
    search method.  (#2987)

  - Adds new API for querying records.

  - Adds new configuration option SEARCH_WALKERS which specifies
    visitor classes that should be applied to a search query.

  - Adds additional search units for the auxiliary author fields
    `firstauthor`, `exactauthor`, `exactfirstauthor` and
    `authorityauthor`.

  - Adds missing operator handling of greater than (>) queries.

    restart current task.

Improved features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ accounts:

  - Improves legend alignment in login form.

+ classifier:

  - Improves the stripping of reference section when extracting text
    from PDF by using a more appropriate refextract API.

+ deposit:

  - Corrects reflow on narrow screens and removes misused classes for
    labels.

  - Adds sticky navigation item to the deposit page to simplify
    overview on larger forms. Works well with collapsed elements. On
    narrow screens the navigation gets pushed in front of all other
    form elements.

  - Improves handling of large files in deposit.

  - Fixes problem with misaligned checkbox and radio list items. They
    are produced because wtforms does not wrap input elements into
    labels as it is intended by the bootstrap framework.

+ docker:

  - Changes port number exposed by docker to non-reserved ones to
    avoid conflicts with local installations. Webport is now 28080,
    Redis 26379 and MySQL is 23306, which is a simple +20000 shift
    from the standard ports.

  - Integrates docker boot script into docker image.

  - Changes docker boot script to use `exec`. This ensure signal
    forwarding and reduces the overhead by one process. As a result
    container shutdown is faster now.

  - Changes manual master/slave configuration of Docker devboot script
    to automatic solution using file locks.

+ formatter:

  - Improves support for translated output format names on search
    results page.  (#2429)

+ global:

  - Supports database creation on PostgreSQL server.

  - Implements session signing. This avoids cache request for invalid
    sessions and reduces the DDoS attack surface.

  - Removes IP address storage+checks. This avoids data privacy issues
    and enables users with multiple connections (e.g. WIFI+LTE,
    multiple WIFI connections on trains+stations) to stay signed in.

  - Enhances `run_py_func` to be able to print both to some StringIO
    and to the terminal at the same time. This is enabled with the
    `passthrough` argument. It now also always returns stderr,
    deprecating the `capture_stderr` argument. The return value is now
    a namedtuple so that one can easily fetch the required value. Its
    arguments to a more natural order (name of the executable first
    and arguments afterwards.

  - Supports database creation on PostgreSQL server.

  - Improves compatibility of Text fields in PostrgeSQL by changing
    Text in models and removes Invenio hacks on MySQL Index and
    Primary Key creation because starting from SQLAlchemy>=1.0 it
    arises an exception if the length is specified. (#3037)

+ knowledge:

  - Relaxes constraints on dynamic search function that used to force
    us to create temporary knowledge base. (#698)

+ legacy:

  - Supports database creation on PostgreSQL server.

+ oauthclient:

  - Extra template block addition.

+ refextract:

  - Replaces usage of 'urllib' by 'requests' library and improves
    manipulation with temporary file used for extraction of
    references.

+ script:

  - Uses SQLAlchemy and SQLAlchemy-Utils to initialize the database
    instead of executing mysql in a python subshell. (#2846) (#2844)

+ search:

  - The search results pages emits proper Cache and TTL information in
    its HTTP headers, so that any eventual external cachers (such as
    varnish) could act accordingly to invalidate their caches
    automatically, without any configuration.  (#2302)

  - Collection filtering of search results no longer returns orphan
    records.

  - Improves native facet creations.

+ template:

  - Replaces Invenio PNG logo with SVG version. This works better on
    high resolution (retina) screens and it is supported by all
    browers.

+ unapi:

  - Separates UnAPI url handling to a new module.

+ upgrader:

  - Clarifies that the upgrade dependency is only a best guess.
    (#2561)

+ workflows:

  - Updates the layout of the details pages in Holding Pen to display
    at which step the object is in the workflow.

  - When rendering the task results, the Holding Pen now passes a
    dictionary instead of a list in order to allow finer grained
    control in the template.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

+ access:

  - Sets the superadmin role ID properly when elaborating access
    authorizations. Previously it was masked behind an application
    context exception. (#3184)

+ accounts:

  - Fixes invalid HTML of the 'remember me' login form checkbox.

  - Corrects conditions on when to sent a notification email.
    (addresses zenodo/zenodo#275) (#3163)

  - Fixes issue that allowed blocked accounts to login.

+ classifier:

  - Properly handles file paths containing a colon (:), avoiding bad
    text extraction that causes (1) wrong results and (2) much slower
    execution.

  - Properly tags the execution of classifier as fast in the standard
    workflow task when applicable.

+ deposit:

  - Fixes issue with PLUpload chunking not being enabled.

  - Fixes "both collapse arrows are shown" bug in deposit frontend.

+ formatter:

  - Changes the mimetype of the `id` output format to application/json
    and properly returns a JSON formatted list of results.

+ indexer:

  - Avoids an exception from happening when passing a unicode string
    to the BibIndex engine washer. (#2981)

+ installation:

  - Fixes capitalization of package names.

+ legacy:

  - Fixes inveniogc crash when mysql is NOT used to store sessions.
    (#3205)

  - Catches also any `MySQLdb.OperationalError` coming from legacy
    MySQL queries using `run_sql()`. (#3089)

  - Fixes an issue with outputting the post-process arguments when
    adding or editing an OAI source.

+ oauthclient:

  - Marks email address of users creating their account with oauth
    process as invalid.

  - Sends a validation email when users create their account with
    oauth. (#2739)

  - Improves security by leaving users' password uninitialized when
    their account is created by the oauth module.

+ records:

  - Improves type consistency of keys and values in JSON record
    created from MARC and retrieved from storage engine.  (#2772)

  - Fixes double message flashing issues during 401 errors.

  - Fixes issue with empty records not returning an 404 error.

  - Fixes 500 error when record does not exist. (#2891)

+ search:

  - Fixes an issue of returning the wrong results when searching for
    single values in the author field (e.g. 'author:ellis').

+ submit:

  - Fixes upgrade recipe for SbmCOLLECTION_SbmCOLLECTION table
    introduced in commit @1021055. (#2954)

+ workflows:

  - Fixes an issue where the workflow engine would try to save a
    function reference in the extra_data task history, causing an
    error when serializing extra_data.

Notes
~~~~~

+ access:

  - The default access role ID for the superadmin user is 1, but it
    can be configured via CFG_SUPERADMINROLE_ID.

  - Requires running `webaccessadmin -u admin -c -a -D` command.

+ accounts:

  - Changes user model fields family name/given names to store empty
    string as default instead of null.

  - Adds support for users to change email address/nickname. If you
    store email addresses in e.g. records or fireroles you are
    responsible for propagating the users change of email address by
    adding listeners to the 'profile-updated' signal. Alternatively
    you can migrate records (using
    CFG_ACC_GRANT_AUTHOR_RIGHTS_TO_USERIDS_IN_TAGS and
    CFG_ACC_GRANT_VIEWER_RIGHTS_TO_USERIDS_IN_TAGS) and fireroles
    (using "allow/deny uid <uid>") to restrict access based on user id
    instead of user email address.

  - Refactors password hashing to (a) explicitly specify password salt
    instead of relying on the email address, since a change of email
    would cause the password to be invalidated (b) support multiple
    password hashing algorithms concurrently (c) automatic migration
    of deprecated hashes when users log in (d) allows overlays to
    specify their preferred hashing algorithms.

  - Deprecates legacy Invenio's hashing algorithm based on AES
    encryption of email address using the password as secret key in
    favor of SHA512 using random salt and 100000 rounds.

+ assets:

  - Updates Twitter Bootstrap to 3.3 to fix some issues, e.g. to low
    colour contrast of navbar background<->font.  Requires update of
    Twitter Bootstrap version in Invenio overlays.

+ collections:

  - The tag table now contains 'collection idetifier' with correct
    'value' and 'recjson_value' ('' and '_collections').

+ formatter:

  - Invenio 1.x BFT template language and BFE elements are being
    deprecated. Please migrate overlay output formats to use Jinja2.
    (#2662)

  - Removes fallback template rendering and puts standard exception
    logging in place.  (#2958)

+ global:

  - Removes unused legacy cascade style sheets.  (#2040)

+ indexer:

  - The lower_index_term() now returns the term as a Unicode string
    which can have an impact on custom tokenizers and regular
    indexing.

+ installation:

  - Adds missing access rights for database user accessing server from
    localhost.  (#3146)

+ records:

  - Ports basic BibDocFile serving including access right checks.
    (#3160)

+ unapi:

  - Add `invenio.modules.unapi` to PACKAGES if you would like to keep
    the `/unapi` url.


Invenio v2.0.4 -- released 2015-06-01
-------------------------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ template:

  - Adds Jinja2 filter 's' to convert anything to 'str'.

Improved features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ BibDocFile:

  - Escapes file name special characters including accents and spaces
    in document URLs.

+ installation:

  - Adds default priviledges for database user to access from any
    host.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

+ arxiv:

  - Adds proper quotation around OAI-PMH query to avoid a query parser
    exception due to colons in the OAI identifiers.

+ global:

  - Catches possible KeyError exceptions when using dotted notation in
    a list to allow for the case when items are missing certain keys.

+ installation:

  - Fixes syntax error in generated Apache virtual host configuration.

+ knowledge:

  - Fixes HTML character encoding in admin templates. (#3118)

+ legacy:

  - Changes the default timestamp to a valid datetime value when
    reindexing via `-R`.

+ WebSearch:

  - Removes special behaviour of the "subject" index that was hard-
    coded based on the index name.  Installations should rather
    specify wanted behaviour by means of configurable tokeniser
    instead.

Invenio v1.2.1 -- released 2015-05-21
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ BibAuthorID:

  - Improves URL redirecting by properly quoting all URL parts, in
    order to better protect against possible XSS attacks.

+ WebStyle:

  - Adds back the `HttpOnly` cookie attribute in order to better
    protect against potential XSS vulnerabilities.  (#3064)

Improved features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ installation:

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIDaemonProcess` user value, taken from the configuration
    variable `CFG_BIBSCHED_PROCESS_USER`, provided it is set.  This
    change makes it easier to run Invenio under non-Apache user
    identity.

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIPythonHome` directive so that it would be easier to run
    Invenio from within Python virtual environments.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

+ BibDocFile:

  - Safer upgrade recipe for migrations from the old document storage
    model (used in v1.1) to the new document storage model (used in
    v1.2).

+ WebSearch:

  - Removes special behaviour of the "subject" index that was hard-
    coded based on the index name.  Installations should rather
    specify wanted behaviour by means of configurable tokeniser
    instead.

  - Collection names containing slashes are now supported again.
    However we recommend not to use slashes in collection names; if
    slashes were wanted for aesthetic reasons, they can be added in
    visible collection translations.  (#2902)

+ global:

  - Replaces `invenio-demo.cern.ch` by `demo.invenio-software.org`
    which is the new canonical URL of the demo site.  (#2867)

+ installation:

  - Releases constraint on using an old version of `h5py` that was
    anyway no longer available on PyPI.

+ testutils:

  - Switches off SSL verification when running the test suite.  Useful
    for Python-2.7.9 where self-signed SSL certificates (that are
    usually used on development installations) would cause apparent
    test failures.  (#2868)

Invenio v1.1.6 -- released 2015-05-21
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ WebStyle:

  - Adds back the `HttpOnly` cookie attribute in order to better
    protect against potential XSS vulnerabilities.  (#3064)

    for Python-2.7.9 where self-signed SSL certificates (that are
    usually used on development installations) would cause apparent
    test failures.  (#2868)

Invenio v2.0.3 -- released 2015-05-15
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ script:

  - Switches from insecure standard random number generator to secure
    OS-driven entropy source (/dev/urandom on linux) for secret key
    generation.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ formatter:

  - Adds html_class and link_label attributes to bfe_edit_record.
    (#3020)

+ script:

  - Adds `SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS` and `SERVER_BIND_PORT` to overwrite
    bind address and port independently from the public URL. This
    gives control over the used network interface as well as the
    ability to bind Invenio to a protected port and use a reverse
    proxy for access. Priority of the config is (1) runserver command
    arguments, (2) `SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS` and `SERVER_BIND_PORT`
    configuration, (3) data from `CFG_SITE_URL`, (4) defaults
    (`127.0.0.1:80`).

Improved features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ docker:

  - Slims down docker image by building on top of less bloated base
    image and only install what is really required. Also purges
    unneeded packages, flushes caches and clean temporary files. All
    these parts should not be in a production image and are also not
    required by developers. You can still install components when
    extending the Invenio base image.

+ docs:

  - Adds missing 'libffi' library and howto start redis server.
    Causing an exception when running `pip install --process-
    dependency-links -e .[development]`: 'ffi.h' file not found and
    'sudo: service: command not found' when starting redis server (OS
    X Yosemite, 10.10).

  - Adds a step describing how to install MySQL on CentOS 7 because it
    does not have 'mysql-server' package by default.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

+ email:

  - Fixes 'send_email' to expect an 'EmailMessage' object from the
    'forge_email' method rather than a string-like object. (#3076)

  - Fixes reference to CFG_SITE_ADMIN_EMAIL (not a global).

+ legacy:

  - Makes lazy loading of `stopwords_kb` variable to avoid file
    parsing during script loading.  (#1462)

+ logging:

  - Fixes Sentry proxy definition pointing to a wrong application
    attribute.

+ matcher:

  - Fixes Unicode conversion required to use the levenshtein_distance
    function. (#3047)

Invenio v2.0.2 -- released 2015-04-17
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ celery:

  - Forces Celery to only accept msgpack content when using standard
    configuration. This disallows pickle messages which can be used
    for remote code execution.  (#3003)

+ global:

  - Disables all attempts to serve directory listings for directories
    found under static root.

Incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ celery:

  - If you use any Celery serializer other than msgpack, you must
    update configuration variable CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT to include
    that serializer.

+ pidstore:

  - Refactors DataCite provider to use the new external DataCite API
    client.

  - Removes DataCite API client from Invenio.

    SECURITY, FIX, etc.) used in automatic generation of structured
    release notes.  (#2856)

+ global:

  - Adds a `inveniomanage config locate` command to request the
    location of the instance config file.

  - Adds new configurable variable `INVENIO_APP_CONFIG_ENVS` that can
    be set both from `invenio.cfg` and OS environment. Application
    factory iterates over comma separated list of configuration
    variable names and updates application config with equivalent OS
    environment value.  (#2858)

+ template:

  - Adds 'u' filter that converts str to unicode in Jinja2 templates
    since support for str has been deprecated. Example: `{{ mystr|u
    }}`.  (#2862)

Improved features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ docs:

  - Adds example of how to deprecate a feature and includes
    deprecation policy in documentation.

+ global:

  - Moves datacite API wrapper to external package.

  - Escapes all unicode characters in Jinja2 templates.

+ installation:

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIDaemonProcess` user value, taken from the configuration
    variable `CFG_BIBSCHED_PROCESS_USER`, provided it is set.  This
    change makes it easier to run Invenio under non-Apache user
    identity.

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIPythonHome` directive so that it would be easier to run
    Invenio from within Python virtual environments.

+ jsonalchemy:

  - Introduces support for accepting MARC fields having any
    indicator. (#1722 #2075)

    order to fix unexpected behavior of the `option` class contructor.
    (#2777 #2864 #2921)

+ documents:

  - Flask-Login import in field definition.  (#2905)

  - Safer upgrade recipe for migrations from the old document storage
    model (used in v1.1) to the new document storage model (used in
    v1.2).

+ global:

  - Drops support for serving directories in Apache site configuration
    to avoid problems with loading '/admin' url without trailing slash
    that attempts to serve the static directory of the same
    name. (#2470 #2943)

+ installation:

  - Adds Babel as setup requirements for installing compile_catalog
    command.

+ jsonalchemy:

  - Fixes the definition of time_and_place_of_event_note,
    series_statement and source_of_description fields.

+ oairepository:

  - Switches keys in CFG_OAI_METADATA_FORMATS configuration mapping.
