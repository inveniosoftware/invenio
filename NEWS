Invenio v2.0.4 -- released 2015-06-01
-------------------------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ template:

  - Adds Jinja2 filter 's' to convert anything to 'str'.

Improved features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ BibDocFile:

  - Escapes file name special characters including accents and spaces
    in document URLs.

+ installation:

  - Adds default priviledges for database user to access from any
    host.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

+ arxiv:

  - Adds proper quotation around OAI-PMH query to avoid a query parser
    exception due to colons in the OAI identifiers.

+ global:

  - Catches possible KeyError exceptions when using dotted notation in
    a list to allow for the case when items are missing certain keys.

+ installation:

  - Fixes syntax error in generated Apache virtual host configuration.

+ knowledge:

  - Fixes HTML character encoding in admin templates. (#3118)

+ legacy:

  - Changes the default timestamp to a valid datetime value when
    reindexing via `-R`.

+ WebSearch:

  - Removes special behaviour of the "subject" index that was hard-
    coded based on the index name.  Installations should rather
    specify wanted behaviour by means of configurable tokeniser
    instead.

Invenio v1.2.1 -- released 2015-05-21
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ BibAuthorID:

  - Improves URL redirecting by properly quoting all URL parts, in
    order to better protect against possible XSS attacks.

+ WebStyle:

  - Adds back the `HttpOnly` cookie attribute in order to better
    protect against potential XSS vulnerabilities.  (#3064)

Improved features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ installation:

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIDaemonProcess` user value, taken from the configuration
    variable `CFG_BIBSCHED_PROCESS_USER`, provided it is set.  This
    change makes it easier to run Invenio under non-Apache user
    identity.

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIPythonHome` directive so that it would be easier to run
    Invenio from within Python virtual environments.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

+ BibDocFile:

  - Safer upgrade recipe for migrations from the old document storage
    model (used in v1.1) to the new document storage model (used in
    v1.2).

+ WebSearch:

  - Removes special behaviour of the "subject" index that was hard-
    coded based on the index name.  Installations should rather
    specify wanted behaviour by means of configurable tokeniser
    instead.

  - Collection names containing slashes are now supported again.
    However we recommend not to use slashes in collection names; if
    slashes were wanted for aesthetic reasons, they can be added in
    visible collection translations.  (#2902)

+ global:

  - Replaces `invenio-demo.cern.ch` by `demo.invenio-software.org`
    which is the new canonical URL of the demo site.  (#2867)

+ installation:

  - Releases constraint on using an old version of `h5py` that was
    anyway no longer available on PyPI.

+ testutils:

  - Switches off SSL verification when running the test suite.  Useful
    for Python-2.7.9 where self-signed SSL certificates (that are
    usually used on development installations) would cause apparent
    test failures.  (#2868)

Invenio v1.1.6 -- released 2015-05-21
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ WebStyle:

  - Adds back the `HttpOnly` cookie attribute in order to better
    protect against potential XSS vulnerabilities.  (#3064)

    identity.

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIPythonHome` directive so that it would be easier to run
    Invenio from within Python virtual environments.

    for Python-2.7.9 where self-signed SSL certificates (that are
    usually used on development installations) would cause apparent
    test failures.  (#2868)

Invenio v1.0.9 -- released 2015-05-21
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ WebStyle:

  - Adds back the `HttpOnly` cookie attribute in order to better
    protect against potential XSS vulnerabilities.  (#3064)

    usually used on development installations) would cause apparent
    test failures.  (#2868)

Invenio v2.0.3 -- released 2015-05-15
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ script:

  - Switches from insecure standard random number generator to secure
    OS-driven entropy source (/dev/urandom on linux) for secret key
    generation.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ formatter:

  - Adds html_class and link_label attributes to bfe_edit_record.
    (#3020)

+ script:

  - Adds `SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS` and `SERVER_BIND_PORT` to overwrite
    bind address and port independently from the public URL. This
    gives control over the used network interface as well as the
    ability to bind Invenio to a protected port and use a reverse
    proxy for access. Priority of the config is (1) runserver command
    arguments, (2) `SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS` and `SERVER_BIND_PORT`
    configuration, (3) data from `CFG_SITE_URL`, (4) defaults
    (`127.0.0.1:80`).

Improved features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ docker:

  - Slims down docker image by building on top of less bloated base
    image and only install what is really required. Also purges
    unneeded packages, flushes caches and clean temporary files. All
    these parts should not be in a production image and are also not
    required by developers. You can still install components when
    extending the Invenio base image.

+ docs:

  - Adds missing 'libffi' library and howto start redis server.
    Causing an exception when running `pip install --process-
    dependency-links -e .[development]`: 'ffi.h' file not found and
    'sudo: service: command not found' when starting redis server (OS
    X Yosemite, 10.10).

  - Adds a step describing how to install MySQL on CentOS 7 because it
    does not have 'mysql-server' package by default.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

+ email:

  - Fixes 'send_email' to expect an 'EmailMessage' object from the
    'forge_email' method rather than a string-like object. (#3076)

  - Fixes reference to CFG_SITE_ADMIN_EMAIL (not a global).

+ legacy:

  - Makes lazy loading of `stopwords_kb` variable to avoid file
    parsing during script loading.  (#1462)

+ logging:

  - Fixes Sentry proxy definition pointing to a wrong application
    attribute.

+ matcher:

  - Fixes Unicode conversion required to use the levenshtein_distance
    function. (#3047)

Invenio v2.0.2 -- released 2015-04-17
-------------------------------------

Security fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ celery:

  - Forces Celery to only accept msgpack content when using standard
    configuration. This disallows pickle messages which can be used
    for remote code execution.  (#3003)

+ global:

  - Disables all attempts to serve directory listings for directories
    found under static root.

Incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ celery:

  - If you use any Celery serializer other than msgpack, you must
    update configuration variable CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT to include
    that serializer.

+ pidstore:

  - Refactors DataCite provider to use the new external DataCite API
    client.

  - Removes DataCite API client from Invenio.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ docs:

  - Adds "Code of Conduct" to the "Community" documentation.

  - Adds new fast track deprecation policy.

  - Documents commit message labels used by developers (such as NEW,
    SECURITY, FIX, etc.) used in automatic generation of structured
    release notes.  (#2856)

+ global:

  - Adds a `inveniomanage config locate` command to request the
    location of the instance config file.

  - Adds new configurable variable `INVENIO_APP_CONFIG_ENVS` that can
    be set both from `invenio.cfg` and OS environment. Application
    factory iterates over comma separated list of configuration
    variable names and updates application config with equivalent OS
    environment value.  (#2858)

+ template:

  - Adds 'u' filter that converts str to unicode in Jinja2 templates
    since support for str has been deprecated. Example: `{{ mystr|u
    }}`.  (#2862)

Improved features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ docs:

  - Adds example of how to deprecate a feature and includes
    deprecation policy in documentation.

+ global:

  - Moves datacite API wrapper to external package.

  - Escapes all unicode characters in Jinja2 templates.

+ installation:

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIDaemonProcess` user value, taken from the configuration
    variable `CFG_BIBSCHED_PROCESS_USER`, provided it is set.  This
    change makes it easier to run Invenio under non-Apache user
    identity.

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIPythonHome` directive so that it would be easier to run
    Invenio from within Python virtual environments.

    indicator. (#1722 #2075)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

+ admin:

  - Adds `admin.js` bundle that loads `select2.js` library on `/admin`
    pages.  (#2690 #2781)

+ assets:

  - Implements `__deepcopy__` method for `webassets.filter.option` in
    order to fix unexpected behavior of the `option` class contructor.
    (#2777 #2864 #2921)

+ documents:

  - Flask-Login import in field definition.  (#2905)

  - Safer upgrade recipe for migrations from the old document storage
    model (used in v1.1) to the new document storage model (used in
    v1.2).

+ global:

  - Drops support for serving directories in Apache site configuration
    to avoid problems with loading '/admin' url without trailing slash
    that attempts to serve the static directory of the same
    name. (#2470 #2943)

+ installation:

  - Adds Babel as setup requirements for installing compile_catalog
    command.

+ jsonalchemy:

  - Fixes the definition of time_and_place_of_event_note,
    series_statement and source_of_description fields.

+ oairepository:

  - Switches keys in CFG_OAI_METADATA_FORMATS configuration mapping.

    not return a tuple anymore.

+ search:

  - Fixes portalbox text overflow and and syntax error in CSS.
    (#3023)

  - Deprecates custom remote debuggers. Please use native Werkzeug
    debugger or other (*)pdb equivalents.  (#2945)

  - Adds deprecation warning for `invenio.ext.jinja2hacks` and all
    detected non-ascii strings usage in templates mainly coming from
    legacy (1.x) modules.  (#2862)

+ installation:

  - Limits version of SQLAlchemy<=1.0 and SQLAlchemy-Utils<=0.30.

+ oairepository:
