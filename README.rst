Invenio is a free software suite enabling you to run your own digital
library or document repository on the web.  The technology offered by
the software covers all aspects of digital library management, from
document ingestion through classification, indexing, and curation up
to document dissemination.  Invenio complies with standards such as
the Open Archives Initiative and uses MARC 21 as its underlying
bibliographic format.  The flexibility and performance of Invenio make
it a comprehensive solution for management of document repositories of
moderate to large sizes.

Invenio has been originally developed at CERN to run the CERN document
server, managing over 1,000,000 bibliographic records in high-energy
physics since 2002, covering articles, books, journals, photos,
videos, and more.  Invenio is nowadays co-developed by an
international collaboration comprising institutes such as CERN, DESY,
EPFL, FNAL, SLAC and is being used by many more scientific
institutions worldwide.

We aim at user friendliness and speed.  Among the features are:

- Navigable collection tree

  - Documents organised in collections
  - Regular and virtual collection trees
  - Customisable portal pages for each collection
  - At CERN, over 1,000,000 documents in 700 collections

- Powerful search engine

  - Specially designed indexes to provide fast search speed
    for repositories of up to 3,000,000 records
  - Customisable simple and advanced search interfaces
  - Combined metadata, fulltext and citation search in one go
