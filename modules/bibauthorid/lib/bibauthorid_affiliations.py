"""Affiliation related functions

This is called in bibauthorid and using BibAuthorId data generates a table with
the affiliations for each author appearing in a paper. This is used later in:
* BibEdit to propose affiliations for those authors that don't have one.
* Rabbit to use the affiliation to assign papers in a fast way.
