    Check that user is either the original submitter, or that it
    belongs to the role(s) given as parameter. This enables
    collaborative editing of records, so that collections can be
    curated by a group of people in addition to the original
    submitter.

    If the user has permission, the function ends silently. If not, it
    will raise an InvenioWebSubmitFunctionStop, informing the user that
    they don't have rights and sending them back to the submission web
    form.

    This function makes it unnecessary to protect the submission with
    WebAccess (i.e. 'submit' action): the function can check
    authorizations by itself.
    However if the case the action in which this function is used is
    still protected with WebAccess (eg. an authorization exists for
    the 'submit' action, in 'MBI'), ALL the possible submitters AND
    the curators groups must be linked to the authorization in order
    for WebSubmit to let users reach this function: this function then
    ensures that only curators or submitters of the record will be
    able to continue further.

    A record owner must have her email in the record metadata.

    A record curator must be in the role given as parameter to this
    function.

    WARNING: you must remember that category-based restrictions
    require you to check that the selected category matches the
    document to modify: one can select category 'foo' to modify
    a document submitted in category 'bar', given that submissions
    are indepedendant of the record they create.

    WARNING: for backward compatibility reasons, if no role is given
    as parameter, the function simply check against the WebAccess
    'submit' action, with this submission parameters. It then means
    that anybody connected to the authorization will be able to modify
    ANY of the records this submission can handle.

    @parameters:

       - curator_role: a role or mapping of roles that determine if
                       user is a curator or not. The parameter can
                       simply be the name of a WebAccess role. For eg:
                         curator_photo
                       where 'curator_photo' is a WebAccess role
                       matching curator users for this submission.

                       The parameter can also map the submission
                       categories to different roles, so that
                       different curator groups can be defined. For eg:
                         ARTICLE=curator_art|REPORT=curator_rep|*=curator_gen
                       (syntax: '|' to split mappings, and '=' to map category->role)

                       This specifies that role 'curator_art' is used
                       when category 'Article' is selected (code for
                       this category is 'ARTICLE'), 'curator_rep' when
                       'Report' ('REPORT' code) is selected, and
                       curator_gen in all other cases. * matches all
                       categories.

                       When defining a mapping category->role, and
                       category cannot be retrieved (for eg. with
                       /submit/direct URLs that do not specify
                       category), only the * rule/role is matched.
                       Eg: foo=role1|*=role2 matches role2 only

                       When no role is defined or matched, the curator
                       role is checked against the WebAccess 'submit'
                       action, for current WebSubmit doctype, action
                       and category.

        - curator_flag: the name of a file in which '1' is written if
                        current submitter is a curator. Otherwise, an
                        empty file is written.
                        If no value is given, no file is written.

    @return: Empty string.
    @Exceptions raised: InvenioWebSubmitFunctionStop when user is denied
                permission to work with the record.
