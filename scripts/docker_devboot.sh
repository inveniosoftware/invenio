usage: docker_devboot (master|slave) COMMAND [ARGS...]

Helper script for running multiple docker containers while exactly one shared
Invenio setup is required. For synchronization purposes, a master-slave setup
is required. Beside the decision which container does the Invenio setup and
which container waits, there are no differences between master and slave.

Modes:
    master - run in master mode (exactly ONE container)
    slave - run in slave mode (0 or more containers)

The exit code of the subcommand is preserved.
