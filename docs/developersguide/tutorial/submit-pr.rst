Part 4: Submit a pull-request
=============================

Now that we finished the development, we want to publish it on GitHub.

Push the code
-------------

To do so, we will first list our changes and add them to our local git repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git status
    # shows all the files that have been modified
    git add .
    # adds all the modifications

Let's test our changes before we publish them. See :ref:`run-the-tests` for more information.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./run-tests.sh

If it complains about the manifest, it is because we added new files, but we didn't register them into the ``MANIFEST.in`` file, so let's do so:

.. code-block:: bash

    check-manifest -u

Once all the tests are passing, we can push our code. As we were developing on a branch created locally, we need to push the branch on GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit -am "basic development"
    git push --set-upstream origin dev

Create a Pull Request (PR)
--------------------------

We want that our changes get merged into the main branch (master) of the repository. So, let's go to the GitHub repository. From here, you can click on the *branch* button.

.. image:: resources/branch.png
    :align: center

Then, click on *New pull request*

.. image:: resources/pr.png
    :align: center

Now, you can check the differences that you will add to the main branch. Fill a description and create the pull request.
