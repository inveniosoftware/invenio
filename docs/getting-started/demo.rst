Demo and Example Sites
======================

There are several Invenio installations that you can have a look at in
order to see it in action:

Demo Sites
----------

`Atlantis Institute of Fictive Science <http://invenio-demo.cern.ch/>`_
    *running Invenio 1.1.2, released 2013-08-19*

    Atlantis Institute of Fictive Science is an official demo site of
    Invenio.  It demonstrates a basic setup of Invenio. You could
    (should) obtain this site if you install Invenio for the first
    time, by lauching 
    `inveniomanage demosite create`. This is useful to verify the
    functionality of your installation prior to customizing the system
    for production.

`Atlantis Institute of Fictive Science Next <http://invenio-demo-next.cern.ch/>`_
    *running Invenio next branch*

    Atlantis Institute of Fictive Science is an official demo site of
    Invenio.  It demonstrates a basic setup of Invenio. You could
    (should) obtain this site if you install Invenio next branch for the first
    time, by lauching 
    `inveniomanage demosite create`. This is useful to verify the
    functionality of your installation prior to customizing the system
    for production. (The next branch is based on new technologies such as
    `Werkzeug <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/>`_, `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_,
    `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_,
    `Twitter Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ and
    `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_).

`CERN Document Server <http://cds.cern.ch>`_
   *CERN, Geneva, Switzerland*

   At CERN, Invenio manages over 800,000 bibliographic records and
   350,000 fulltext documents, organized in more than 500
   collections, covering preprints, articles, books, journals,
   photographs, videos and more, of interest to people working in
   particle physics. You can check out this site if you want to see
   the performance and scalability of Invenio.

`INSPIRE <http://inspirebeta.net>`_
   *CERN, Geneva, Switzerland*

   INSPIRE is the high-energy physics information system that combines the
   successful `SPIRES <http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires>`_ database
   content, curated at `DESY <http://www.desy.de/>`_, `Fermilab
   <http://www.fnal.gov/>`_ and `SLAC <http://www.slac.stanford.edu/>`_
   for decades, with the Invenio digital library technology developed at
   `CERN <http://www.cern.ch/>`_. INSPIRE is run by a collaboration of the
   four labs and interacts closely with high-energy physics publishers,
   `arXiv.org <http://arxiv.org/>`_, `NASA-ADS <http://adswww.harvard.edu/>`_,
   `PDG <http://pdg.lbl.gov/>`_, and other information resources.
