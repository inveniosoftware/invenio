Welcome to Invenio's documentation.  This documentation is divided into
different parts.  We recommend that you get started with
:ref:`first-steps` and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`.
Besides the quickstart, there is also a more detailed :ref:`tutorial` that
shows how to create a complete application with Invenio.  If
you'd rather dive into the internals of Invenio, check out
the :ref:`api` documentation.  Common patterns are described in the
:ref:`patterns` section.

Invenio depends on several external libraries:

- the `Flask`_ microframework for Python (based on `Werkzeug`_ and `Jinja2`_),
- the `Jinja2`_ template engine,
- the `Werkzeug`_ WSGI toolkit,
- the `SQLAlchemy`_ SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper.

These libraries are not documented here. If you want to dive into their
documentation, check out the following links:

- `Flask Documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/documentation/>`_
- `Jinja2 Documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`_
- `Werkzeug Documentation <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/documentation/>`_
- `SQLAlchemy Documentation <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/>`_
