Developer environment guide
===========================
You can save a lot of time and frustrations by spending some time setting up
your development environment. We have primarily adopted existing community
style guides, and in most cases the formatting and checking can be fully
automated by your editor.

Editor
------
You can use any code editor of your choice. Here we give a brief overview of
some of the editors our existing developers are using. For all editors, the
most important is support for `EditorConfig <https://editorconfig.org>`_

EditorConfig
~~~~~~~~~~~~
All repositories have a ``.editorconfig`` file which defines indention style,
text encoding, newlines etc. Many editors either come with built-in support
or plugins that reads the ``.editorconfig`` file and configures your editor
accordingly.

See `EditorConfig <https://editorconfig.org>`_ for list of supported editors.

Editors
~~~~~~~
Following editors (listed alphabetically) are used by our existing developers.
Don't hesitate to reach out on our Gitter channel, to ask for help for useful
plugins:

- `Atom <https://atom.io>`_
- `Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_
- `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_
- `Sublime <https://www.sublimetext.com>`_
- `VIM <https://www.vim.org>`_
- `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_

Plugins for editors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The key plugins you should look for in your editor of choice are:

- Python / JavaScript environment
- PEP8 / PEP257 style checking
- `Isort <https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ plugin.
