Upgrading
=========

Invenio community is working hard on new features and
fixing bugs that were found after release. While the
upgrade can be a complex process at times, running
the latest Invenio version has several benefits:

- New features and improvements are added.
- Bugs are fixed.
- Upgrading as each new Invenio release is available
  makes future upgrades less painful by keeping your
  code base up to date.
