Scaffolding
-----------
Following modules provide templates for getting started with Invenio:

- `cookiecutter-invenio-instance <https://github.com/inveniosoftware/cookiecutter-invenio-instance>`_

Notes on license
----------------
Invenio is undergoing a change of license from GPLv2 to MIT License in most
cases. Thus, you may especially for alpha and beta modules see that the license
is still GPL v2 in the source code. This will be changed to MIT License for
all repositories before being finally released. The only module we are
currently aware of that can not be converted is Invenio-Query-Parser, which
has a dependency on a GPL-licensed library. Invenio-Query-Parser is however not
needed by most installations, as it only provides an Invenio v1.x compatible
query parser.
