System requirements
-------------------
Invenio can run in both Docker, virtual machines and physical machines. Invenio
can run on a single machine or a cluster of 100s of machines. It all
depends on exactly how much data you are handling and your performance
requirements.

Following is an estimate of a small, medium and large installation of Invenio.
The purpose is only to provide a **very rough** idea about how an Invenio
installation could look like.

**Small installation:**

- Web/app/background servers and Redis: 1 node
- Database: 1 node
- Elasticsearch: 1 node

**Medium installation:**

- Load balancer: 1 node
- Web/app servers and background workers: 2 nodes
- Database: 1 node
- Elasticsearch: 3 nodes
- Redis/RabbitMQ: 1 node

**Large installation:**

- Load balancer: 2 node (with DNS load balancing)
- Web/app servers: 3+ nodes
- Background workers: 3+ nodes
- Database: 2 nodes (master/slave)
- Elasticsearch: 5 nodes (3 data, 2 clients)
- Redis: 3 nodes (HA setup)
- RabbitMQ: 2 nodes (HA setup)
