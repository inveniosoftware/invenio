0. Prerequisites
================

   Here is the software you need to have around before you
   start installing CDS Invenio:

     a) Unix-like operating system.  The main development and
        production platforms for CDS Invenio at CERN are GNU/Linux
        distributions SLC (RHEL), Debian, and Gentoo, but we also
        develop on FreeBSD and Mac OS X.  Basically any Unix system
        supporting the software listed below should do.

        Note that if you are using Debian "Sarge" GNU/Linux, you can
        install most of the below-mentioned prerequisites and
        recommendations by running:

          $ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-python2.3 \
              apache2-mpm-prefork mysql-server-4.1 mysql-client-4.1 \
              python2.3-mysqldb python2.3-4suite \
              python2.3-xml python2.3-libxml2 python2.3-libxslt1 \
              rxp gnuplot xpdf-utils gs-common antiword catdoc \
              wv html2text ppthtml xlhtml clisp gettext

        You can also install the following packages:

          $ sudo apt-get install python2.3-psyco sbcl cmucl

        The last three packages are not available on all Debian
        "Sarge" GNU/Linux architectures (e.g. not on AMD64); you can
        safely continue without them.

        Note that you can consult CDS Invenio wiki pages at
        <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CDS/Invenio> for more
        system-specific notes.

        Note that the web application server should run a Message
        Transfer Agent (MTA) such as Postfix so that CDS Invenio can
        email notification alerts or registration information to the
        end users, contact moderators and reviewers of submitted
        documents, inform administrators about various runtime system
        information, etc.

     b) MySQL server (may be on a remote machine), and MySQL client
        (must be available locally too).  MySQL versions 4.1 or 5.0
        are supported.  Please set the variable "max_allowed_packet"
        in your "my.cnf" init file to at least 4M.  You may also want
        to run your MySQL server natively in UTF-8 mode by setting
        "default-character-set=utf8" in various parts of your "my.cnf"
        file, such as in the "[mysql]" part and elsewhere.
        <http://mysql.com/>

     c) Apache 2 server, with support for loading DSO modules, and
        optionally with SSL support for HTTPS-secure user
        authentication.  Tested mainly with version 2.0.43 and above.
        Apache 2.x is required for the mod_python module (see below).
          <http://httpd.apache.org/>

     d) Python v2.3 or above:
          <http://python.org/>
        as well as the following Python modules:
          - (mandatory) MySQLdb (version >= 1.2.1_p2; see below)
             <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python>
          - (recommended) PyXML, for XML processing:
             <http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/download.html>
          - (recommended) PyRXP, for very fast XML MARC processing:
             <http://www.reportlab.org/pyrxp.html>
          - (recommended) libxml2-python, for XML/XLST processing:
             <ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/python/>
          - (recommended) Gnuplot.Py, for producing graphs:
             <http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/>
          - (recommended) Snowball Stemmer, for stemming:
             <http://snowball.tartarus.org/wrappers/PyStemmer-1.0.1.tar.gz>
          - (optional) 4suite, slower alternative to PyRXP and
             libxml2-python:
             <http://4suite.org/>
          - (optional) feedparser, for web journal creation:
             <http://feedparser.org/>
          - (optional) Psyco, if you are running on a 32-bit OS:
             <http://psyco.sourceforge.net/>
          - (optional) RDFLib, to use RDF ontologies and thesauri:
             <http://rdflib.net/>
          - (optional) mechanize, to run regression web test suite:
             <http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/>

        Note: MySQLdb version 1.2.1_p2 or higher is recommended.  If
              you are using an older version of MySQLdb, you may get
              into problems with character encoding.

     e) mod_python Apache module.  Tested mainly with versions
        3.0BETA4 and above.  mod_python 3.x is required for Apache 2.
        Previous versions (as well as Apache 1 ones) exhibited some
        problems with MySQL connectivity in our experience.
          <http://www.modpython.org/>

     f) If you want to be able to extract references from PDF fulltext
        files, then you need to install pdftotext version 3 at least.
          <http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/home.html>

     g) If you want to be able to search for words in the fulltext
        files (i.e. to have fulltext indexing) or to stamp submitted
        files, then you need as well to install some of the following
        tools:
          - for PDF file stamping: pdftk, pdf2ps
              <http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/>
              <http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/>
          - for PDF files: pdftotext or pstotext
              <http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/home.html>
              <http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/>
          - for PostScript files: pstotext or ps2ascii
              <http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/>
          - for MS Word files: antiword, catdoc, or wvText
              <http://www.winfield.demon.nl/index.html>
              <http://www.ice.ru/~vitus/catdoc/index.html>
              <http://sourceforge.net/projects/wvware>
          - for MS PowerPoint files: pptHtml and html2text
              <http://packages.debian.org/stable/utils/ppthtml>
              <http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~mbayer/tools/html2text.html>
          - for MS Excel files: xlhtml and html2text
              <http://chicago.sourceforge.net/xlhtml/>
              <http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~mbayer/tools/html2text.html>

     h) If you have chosen to install fast XML MARC Python processors
        in the step d) above, then you have to install the parsers
        themselves:
          - (optional) RXP:
             <http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/rxp.html>
          - (optional) 4suite:
             <http://4suite.org/>

     i) (recommended) Gnuplot, the command-line driven interactive
        plotting program.  It is used to display download and citation
        history graphs on the Detailed record pages on the web
        interface.  Note that Gnuplot must be compiled with PNG output
        support, that is, with the GD library.  Note also that Gnuplot
        is not required, only recommended.
          <http://www.gnuplot.info/>

     j) (recommended) A Common Lisp implementation, such as CLISP,
        SBCL or CMUCL.  It is used for the web server log analysing
        tool and the metadata checking program.  Note that any of the
        three implementations CLISP, SBCL, or CMUCL will do.  CMUCL
        produces fastest machine code, but it does not support UTF-8
        yet.  Pick up CLISP if you don't know what to do.  Note that a
        Common Lisp implementation is not required, only recommended.
          <http://clisp.cons.org/>
          <http://www.cons.org/cmucl/>
          <http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/>

     k) GNU gettext, a set of tools that makes it possible to
	translate the application in multiple languages.
           <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
	This is available by default on many systems.

   Note that the configure script checks whether you have all the
   prerequisite software installed and that it won't let you continue
   unless everything is in order.  It also warns you if it cannot find
   some optional but recommended software.

2. Detailed instructions for the patient CDS Invenio admin
==========================================================

2a. Installation
----------------

    The CDS Invenio uses standard GNU autoconf method to build and
    install its files.  This means that you proceed as follows:

      $ cd /usr/local/src/

          Change to a directory where we will configure and build the
          CDS Invenio.  (The built files will be installed into
          different "target" directories later.)

      $ wget http://invenio-software.org/download/cds-invenio-0.99.8.tar.gz
      $ wget http://invenio-software.org/download/cds-invenio-0.99.8.tar.gz.md5
      $ wget http://invenio-software.org/download/cds-invenio-0.99.8.tar.gz.sig

          Fetch CDS Invenio source tarball from the CDS Software
          Consortium distribution server, together with MD5 checksum
          and GnuPG cryptographic signature files useful for verifying
          the integrity of the tarball.

      $ md5sum -v -c cds-invenio-0.99.8.tar.gz.md5

          Verify MD5 checksum.

      $ gpg --verify cds-invenio-0.99.8.tar.gz.sig cds-invenio-0.99.8.tar.gz

          Verify GnuPG cryptographic signature.  Note that you may
          first have to import my public key into your keyring, if you
          haven't done that already:
            $ gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net --recv-keys 0xBA5A2B67
          The output of the gpg --verify command should then read:
            Good signature from "Tibor Simko <tibor@simko.info>"
          You can safely ignore any trusted signature certification
          warning that may follow after the signature has been
          successfully verified.

      $ tar xvfz cds-invenio-0.99.8.tar.gz

          Untar the distribution tarball.

      $ cd cds-invenio-0.99.8

          Go to the source directory.

      $ ./configure

          Configure CDS Invenio software for building on this specific
          platform.  You can use the following optional parameters:

              --prefix=/opt/cds-invenio

                 Optionally, specify the CDS Invenio general
                 installation directory (default is /opt/cds-invenio).
                 It will contain command-line binaries and program
                 libraries containing the core CDS Invenio
                 functionality, but also store web pages, runtime log
                 and cache information, document data files, etc.
                 Several subdirs like `bin', `etc', `lib', or `var'
                 will be created inside the prefix directory to this
                 effect.  Note that the prefix directory should be
                 chosen outside of the Apache htdocs tree, since only
                 one its subdirectory (prefix/var/www) is to be
                 accessible directly via the Web (see below).

                 Note that CDS Invenio won't install to any other
                 directory but to the prefix mentioned in this
                 configuration line.

              --with-python=/opt/python/bin/python2.3

                 Optionally, specify a path to some specific Python
                 binary.  This is useful if you have more than one
                 Python installation on your system.  If you don't set
                 this option, then the first Python that will be found
                 in your PATH will be chosen for running CDS Invenio.

              --with-mysql=/opt/mysql/bin/mysql

                 Optionally, specify a path to some specific MySQL
                 client binary.  This is useful if you have more than
                 one MySQL installation on your system.  If you don't
                 set this option, then the first MySQL client
                 executable that will be found in your PATH will be
                 chosen for running CDS Invenio.

              --with-clisp=/opt/clisp/bin/clisp

                 Optionally, specify a path to CLISP executable.  This
                 is useful if you have more than one CLISP
                 installation on your system.  If you don't set this
                 option, then the first executable that will be found
                 in your PATH will be chosen for running CDS Invenio.

              --with-cmucl=/opt/cmucl/bin/lisp

                 Optionally, specify a path to CMUCL executable.  This
                 is useful if you have more than one CMUCL
                 installation on your system.  If you don't set this
                 option, then the first executable that will be found
                 in your PATH will be chosen for running CDS Invenio.

              --with-sbcl=/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl

                 Optionally, specify a path to SBCL executable.  This
                 is useful if you have more than one SBCL
                 installation on your system.  If you don't set this
                 option, then the first executable that will be found
                 in your PATH will be chosen for running CDS Invenio.

          This configuration step is mandatory.  Usually, you do this
          step only once.

          (Note that if you prefer to build CDS Invenio out of its
          source tree, you may run the above configure command like
          this: mkdir build && cd build && ../configure --prefix=...
          FIXME: this is not working right now as per the introduction
          of intbitset_setup.py.)

      $ make

          Launch the CDS Invenio build.  Since many messages are printed
          during the build process, you may want to run it in a
          fast-scrolling terminal such as rxvt or in a detached screen
          session.

          During this step all the pages and scripts will be
          pre-created and customized based on the config you have
          edited in the previous step.

          Note that on systems such as FreeBSD or Mac OS X you have to
          use GNU make ("gmake") instead of "make".

      $ make install

          Install the web pages, scripts, utilities and everything
          needed for CDS Invenio runtime into respective installation
          directories, as specified earlier by the configure command.

          Note that if you are installing CDS Invenio for the first
          time, you will be asked to create symbolic link(s) from
          Python's site-packages system-wide directory(ies) to the
          installation location.  This is in order to instruct Python
          where to find CDS Invenio's Python files.  You will be
          hinted as to the exact command to use based on the
          parameters you have used in the configure command.

      $ sudo make install-jsmath-plugin  ## optional

          This will automatically download and install in the proper
          place jsMath, a Javascript library to render LaTeX formulas
          in the client browser.

          Note that in order to enable the rendering you will have to
          set the variable CFG_WEBSEARCH_USE_JSMATH_FOR_FORMATS in
          invenio.conf to a suitable list of output format codes. For
          example:
          CFG_WEBSEARCH_USE_JSMATH_FOR_FORMATS = hd,hb

2b. Configuration
-----------------

    Once the basic software installation is done, we proceed to
    configuring your Invenio system.

      $ emacs /opt/cds-invenio/etc/invenio.conf
      $ emacs /opt/cds-invenio/etc/invenio-local.conf

          Customize your CDS Invenio installation.  The 'invenio.conf'
          file contains the vanilla default configuration parameters
          of a CDS Invenio installation, as coming from the
          distribution.  You could in principle go ahead and change
          the values according to your local needs.

          However, you can also create a file named
          'invenio-local.conf' in the same directory where
          'invenio.conf' lives and put there only the localizations
          you need to have different from the default ones.  For
          example:

             $ cat /opt/cds-invenio/etc/invenio-local.conf
             [Invenio]
             CFG_SITE_URL = http://your.site.com
             CFG_SITE_SECURE_URL = https://your.site.com
             CFG_SITE_ADMIN_EMAIL = john.doe@your.site.com
             CFG_SITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL = john.doe@your.site.com

          The Invenio system will then read both the default
          invenio.conf file and your customized invenio-local.conf
          file and it will override any default options with the ones
          you have set in your local file.  This cascading of
          configuration parameters will ease you future upgrades.

          You should override at least the parameters from the top of
          invenio.conf file in order to define some very essential
          runtime parameters such as the visible URL of your document
          server (look for CFG_SITE_URL and CFG_SITE_SECURE_URL), the
          database credentials (look for CFG_DATABASE_*), the name of
          your document server (look for CFG_SITE_NAME and
          CFG_SITE_NAME_INTL_*), or the email address of the local CDS
          Invenio administrator (look for CFG_SITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL and
          CFG_SITE_ADMIN_EMAIL).

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --update-all

          Make the rest of the Invenio system aware of your
          invenio.conf changes.  This step is mandatory each time you
          edit your conf files.

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --create-tables

          If you are installing CDS Invenio for the first time, you
          have to create database tables.

          Note that this step checks for potential problems such as
          the database connection rights and may ask you to perform
          some more administrative steps in case it detects a problem.
          Notably, it may ask you to set up database access
          permissions, based on your configure values.

          If you are installing CDS Invenio for the first time, you
          have to create a dedicated database on your MySQL server
          that the CDS Invenio can use for its purposes.  Please
          contact your MySQL administrator and ask him to execute the
          commands this step proposes you.

          At this point you should now have successfully completed the
          "make install" process.  We continue by setting up the
          Apache web server.

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --create-apache-conf

          Running this command will generate Apache virtual host
          configurations matching your installation.  You will be
          instructed to check created files (usually they are located
          under /opt/cds-invenio/etc/apache/) and edit your httpd.conf
          to put the following include statements:

             Include /opt/cds-invenio/etc/apache/invenio-apache-vhost.conf
             Include /opt/cds-invenio/etc/apache/invenio-apache-vhost-ssl.conf

      $ sudo /path/to/apache/bin/apachectl graceful

          Please ask your webserver administrator to restart the
          Apache server after the above "httpd.conf" changes.

      $ sudo chgrp -R www-data /opt/cds-invenio
      $ sudo chmod -R g+r /opt/cds-invenio
      $ sudo chmod -R g+rw /opt/cds-invenio/var
      $ sudo find /opt/cds-invenio -type d -exec chmod g+rxw {} \;

          One more superuser step, because we need to enable Apache
          server to read files from the installation place and to
          write some log information and to cache interesting entities
          inside the "var" subdirectory of our CDS Invenio
          installation directory.

          Here we assumed that your Apache server processes are run
          under "www-data" group.  Change this appropriately for your
          system.

          Moreover, note that if you are using SELinux extensions
          (e.g. on Fedora Core 6), you may have to check and enable
          the write access of Apache user there too.

          After these admin-level tasks to be performed as root, let's
          now go back to finish the installation of the CDS Invenio.

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --create-demo-site

          This step is recommended to test your local CDS Invenio
          installation.  It should give you our "Atlantis Institute of
          Science" demo installation, exactly as you see it at
          <http://invenio-demo.cern.ch/>.

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --load-demo-records

          Optionally, load some demo records to be able to test
          indexing and searching of your local CDS Invenio demo
          installation.

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --run-unit-tests

          Optionally, you can run the unit test suite to verify the
          unit behaviour of your local CDS Invenio installation.  Note
          that this command should be run only after you have
          installed the whole system via `make install'.

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --run-regression-tests

           Optionally, you can run the full regression test suite to
           verify the functional behaviour of your local CDS Invenio
           installation.  Note that this command requires to have
           created the demo site and loaded the demo records.  Note
           also that running the regression test suite may alter the
           database content with junk data, so that rebuilding the
           demo site is strongly recommended afterwards.

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --run-web-tests

           Optionally, you can run additional automated web tests
           running in a real browser.  This requires to have Firefox
           with the Selenium IDE extension installed.
           <http://en.www.mozilla.com/en/firefox/>
           <http://selenium-ide.openqa.org/>

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --remove-demo-records

          Optionally, remove the demo records loaded in the previous
          step, but keeping otherwise the demo collection, submission,
          format, and other configurations that you may reuse and
          modify for your own production purposes.

      $ /opt/cds-invenio/bin/inveniocfg --drop-demo-site

          Optionally, drop also all the demo configuration so that
          you'll end up with a completely blank CDS Invenio system.
          However, you may want to find it more practical not to drop
          the demo site configuration but to start customizing from
          there.

      $ firefox http://your.site.com/help/admin/howto-run

          In order to start using your CDS Invenio installation, you
          can start indexing, formatting and other daemons as
          indicated in the "HOWTO Run" guide on the above URL.  You
          can also use the Admin Area web interfaces to perform
          further runtime configurations such as the definition of
          data collections, document types, document formats, word
          indexes, etc.

Good luck, and thanks for choosing CDS Invenio.
