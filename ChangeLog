	BibRank: temporary file storage in CFG_TMPDIR
	* Stores temporary data files used for plotting in CFG_TMPDIR

	WebAccess: IP-based rules and offline user fix
	* Correctly handles a corner case of
	  access_control_firerole.acc_firerole_check_user() where, when
	  checking a guest user created with collect_user_info(None) (hence
	  having the 'remote_ip' key set to '') against an IP-based FireRole
	  rule, would have raised an unhandled exception. (closes #1233)

	* Introduces a new register_exception() statement in order to early
	  discover troubles with acc_firerole_check_user().

2012-10-18  Ludmila Marian <ludmila.marian@gmail.com>

	WebSearch: XSS and verbose improvements
	* The use of 'verbose' parameter for search pages is restricted
          to superadmins only, since it could expose potentially sensitive
          information, such as record IDs even though record content would
          remain restricted.

	* External search XSS vulnerability fix (escapes strings when
          printing debug information via 'verbose' parameter in the external
          search facility).

	WebComment: improve sanity checks
	* When reporting, voting, or replying to a comment, or when accessing
	  comment attachments, ensure that the comment belongs to the given
	  record and is not deleted.  (For example, this prevents malicious

	BibHarvest: OAI harvesting bug fixes
	* Fixed bug that would prevent harvesting of multiple repositories at
	  once (file with harvested data being overwritten by harvesting of
	  next repository... Thanks to Sergio Laberer for having pointed out
	  the problem and helped solving it).

	* Improved parsing of input parameter '--repository' when used with
	  (double-)quotes.

	* Fixed wrong help documentation wrt '--repository' parameter.

	* Fixed bug when calling bibupload with harvested data (when harvesting

	installation: deduce Invenio version dynamically
	* Now that we use git since, ahem, many years, let us deduce Invenio version
	  number dynamically from `git describe'.  Useful for making easier and more
	  precisely numbered development snapshots, not necessitating to bump version
	  numbers statically anymore.
	  (closes #318)

2010-10-15  Jerome Caffaro  <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	  for a valid output.

2010-07-12  Samuele Kaplun  <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	bibdocfile: application/octet-stream by default
	* When streaming a file, if the mime-type to provide in the
	  response HTTP header can not be guessed from the file format,
	  use "application/octet-stream" instead of "text/plain", to
	  force browser to download the file.

2010-06-21  Samuele Kaplun  <Samuele.Kaplun@cern.ch>

	WebSearch: safer protection of restricted records
	* Records (/record/xxx) belonging to restricted collections are now more
	  fully protected, regardless of primary or secondary collection definitions,
	  by checking if the user is either owner of the record or is authorized
	  to access *all* restricted collections to which the record belongs to.

2010-06-21  Benoit Thiell  <benoit.thiell@cern.ch>

	installation: purged multiple targets

	  like Ubuntu that use Python-2.6 in case people happen to be installing
	  old Invenio v0.99 release series there.

	Added user-query check when setting up alerts.
	Added a strict check whether the given user can set up the given query
	as a periodic alert.  This prevents malicious users from playing with
	URL arguments.

	Conflicts:

		modules/webalert/lib/webalert.py
		modules/webalert/lib/webalert_webinterface.py

2010-06-15  Samuele Kaplun  <Samuele.Kaplun@cern.ch>

	bibdocfile: backport extension guessing algorithm
	* Fix extension guessing algorithm by backporting latest version from

	bibdocfile: fix --fix-marc when no files attached

	  which is enough to trigger the fix-marc procedure in BibUpload.

	Added language information to export actions

	Removed removal of default language during link creation.

	BibHarvest: removed trailing '/' in /oai2d baseurl
	* Removed trailing `/' in /oai2d baseurl so that OAI gateway valides.

	Fixed all mutable default arguments.

2010-06-15  Samuele Kaplun  <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	BibEdit: fix adding a field
	* Fixed adding a field in BibEdit.

	* Merge note: this is a quick-fix for maint only; it was fixed in another way
	  in master by Lars.  Also, this particular fix leads to doubling of subfields
	  unless one removes default mutual arguments, which is fixed in
	  1a153fc6b0415d5bb101e3a89c19aca63c7ec51d.

	Fix language Vs field treatment in create_searchwithin_selection_box.

	BibUpload: fixed crash when merging MARC into bibdoc
	* When merging MARC into bibdocfile structure, if a URL is resolved
	  to a docname that is not actually attached to the given record an
	  exception is raised. This exception is now catched and a warning
	  is simply issued.

2010-05-17  Samuele Kaplun  <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	BibIndex: index files with unusual extensions
	* Fixing bug (reported by Devin Bougie) triggered when filename has
	  no extension or is using exotic extension (e.g. Microsoft Office 2007).

	(cherry-picked from 919c5c4489155e3652c6ca19967c5b5475c52a15)

2010-05-13  Samuele Kaplun  <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	BibSched: fix conflict between OS signals and I/O
	* Connected USR2 signal to SIG_IGN. This should solve any conflict raising when
	  pinging a task with USR2 signal for discovering if it's still alive, while the
	  task is performing I/O operation (e.g. downloading an URL). (See
	  <http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.5/lib/module-signal.html>, the fourth dot).

	* This solves notably problem with full-text-indexing remote files.

	(cherry-picked from d7f4373a235c808caccabb068587d7a8afc23422)

2010-05-13  Tibor Simko  <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	git: new .gitignore and sse2f files
	* Installed project-wide .gitignore, with a notable addition of *.sse2f
	  files that are actually FASL files compiled with SSE2 support, as generated
	  by recent versions of CMUCL.

	function is to be renamed properly later.

2008-06-30  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibsched.py: It is happening sometimes that
	a task stays in the status 'SCHEDULED' forever without being
	executed anymore. Checking through logs and code this could happen
	only if bibsched scheduler is stopped before actually submitting
	the task but after having set its status to 'SCHEDULED'. Hence I've
	added a clean instruction at the start of bibsched scheduler to
	reset all scheduled tasks to 'WAITING'.

2008-06-30  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: 8564s MARC will be
	synchronized after bibdocfile tables only if FFT is used or '856'
	tag is present in the MARC.  if MARC comes with 8564s tags with
	bibdocfile urls (i.e. 'CFG_SITE_URL/record/123/files/docname.ext')
	and FFTs have not been used (e.g. because MARC is coming from
	bibedit/aleph/current submission), it will first import $y and $z
	(description and comment) from MARC into bibdocfile, and then
	rebuild all 8564s based on bibdocfile.

2008-06-30  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am, modules/miscutil/sql/tabcreate.sql:

	* configure.ac, config/invenio-autotools.conf.in,
	modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Added checks for md5sum in
	./configure scripts. bibdoc.touch() to not touch record
	modification date. Better handling of exception (e.g. change_file
	to return InvenioWebSubmitFileError in case of error), bibdoc to be
	connected to bibrec only after correct creation.  docsize enlarged
	to bigint in hstDOCUMENT, comments and descriptions got imported
	from 8564s into bibdocfile when 8564s to exist and FFT is not used
	(for backward compatibilities).

2008-06-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py: Adapted
	restricted collection search interface page body test by testing

	modules/miscutil/sql/tabdrop.sql: Dropping final R from
	rnkAUTHORDATAR since there are no forward/reverse twin tables here.

2008-06-29  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Use detected CFG_PATH_WGET.

	detection of wget.

2008-06-29  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/demobibdata.xml: Replaced demo record's FFT
	links that were pointing to arXiv in order to point to CDS instead.
	This is important because automated full-text downloads from arXiv
	are not allowed.  Also, prettified //archive URLs.

2008-06-27  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* config/invenio.conf: Added warning on

	because urllib/socket are influenced by signals(!?)

2008-06-27  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webcoll.py: Do not raise
	exception when collection is unknown, but print error message.

2008-06-27  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/bibharvestadminlib.py: Do not insert new

2008-06-26  Lars Christian Raae <lars.christian.raae@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/lib/access_control_config.py: Added auth so

	advanced search fields in pages generated by WebColl.

2008-06-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_templates.py: Display 'Detailed
	record' link also when the viewer does not have any commenting
	rights; this is important e.g. for public baskets.

2008-06-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_templates.py: Added 'Detailed
	record' links to the standard basket item display.  Renamed
	existing link to 'View comments'.  This is needed in order to
	access full-text files for certain records.  (Note that currently
	only 'hb' and 'xm' output formats are working in baskets, since the
	system searches for pre-generated formats in bibfmt/bskEXTFMT
	tables.  This is to be fixed.)

2008-06-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/democfgdata.sql: Fixed example queries for

	editing because of revision waiting in bibsched queue, a tmp file
	would be created and not deleted. This is fixed. Also replaced use
	of commands library with shellutils for increased safety.

2008-06-24  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibsched.py: Fixed Acknowledge, fixed purge

	'super-simple' search mode (as=-1), as well as reintroduction of
	example search queries.  Default search mode is no longer 0, but
	configured via CFG_DEFAULT_SEARCH_INTERFACE.  Now use
	CFG_WEBSEARCH_ADVANCEDSEARCH_PATTERN_BOX_WIDTH and
	CFG_WEBSEARCH_SIMPLESEARCH_PATTERN_BOX_WIDTH where needed.  Updated
	docstrings.

2008-06-24  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/inveniocfg.py: Treat

	* modules/webstyle/css/cds.css: New 'examplequery' class for
	example query links.

2008-06-24  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* config/invenio.conf: Added CFG_ENABLED_SEARCH_INTERFACES and
	CFG_DEFAULT_SEARCH_INTERFACE config variables in order to choose
	which search modes ('avanced', 'simple' or new experimental
	'super-simple') are enabled, and which of them is the default
	search mode.  Also added
	CFG_WEBSEARCH_SUPERSIMPLESEARCH_PATTERN_BOX_WIDTH to choose search
	box width in super-simple search mode (similar to
	CFG_WEBSEARCH_SIMPLESEARCH_PATTERN_BOX_WIDTH and
	CFG_WEBSEARCH_ADVANCEDSEARCH_PATTERN_BOX_WIDTH)

2008-06-23  Lars Christian Raae <lars.christian.raae@cern.ch>

	modules/bibedit/web/admin/test_bibedit_reedit_warning.html,
	modules/bibedit/lib/bibedit_engine.py: Enriched demo site
	configuration - bibedit now takes collection as optional argument.
	Added both general and collectionspecific curator roles to
	accomodate for this extension. Added five Selenium test cases for
	testing of bibedit functionality.

2008-06-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webalert/lib/webalert.py: Clarified exception message of
	the last commit.

2008-06-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webalert/lib/webalert.py: Raise now an exception to the
	site admin when an alert query was deleted for a user but still
	exists in the list of her alerts.

2008-06-23  Lars Christian Raae <lars.christian.raae@cern.ch>

	(including invalid ones).

2008-06-23  Lars Christian Raae <lars.christian.raae@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibedit_engine.py,
	modules/bibedit/lib/bibedit_templates.py, config/invenio.conf:
	Added CFG_BIBEDIT_LOCKLEVEL - when a user tries to edit a record
	being edited by another user, the lock level determines when it is
	permitted to do so. Levels are 0-4 and are described in
	invenio.conf. Also a minor bugfix; if a user reloaded bibedit while
	editing a record, he would lose state and not be informed that he
	was editing a temporary record.

2008-06-23  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_word_indexer.py: Added new checks for

	* po/el.po: Completed Greek translation, thanks to Theodoros
	Theodoropoulos.

2008-06-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstat/lib/webstat_webinterface.py: Made '/stats' URL
	callable.

2008-06-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: Fixed page() language
	argument.  (It is 'language', not 'ln'.)

2008-06-23  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webpage.py,
	modules/webstyle/lib/webstyle_templates.py: Added "show_title_p"
	parameter to page(..) and tmpl_page(..) functions, so that it is
	possible to show/hide title in the body ('<h1 />') of the page
	independently of its addition in the navtrail, window title and
	HTML metada headers.

2008-06-23  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webstyle_templates.py: Do not create empty
	<h1 /> when page title is not given.

2008-06-20  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/urlutils.py: Fixed "compile-time" reference
	to apache module recently introduced.

	correctly support priority by analysing the parameters.

2008-06-20  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfilecli.py: Correctly escaping xml
	marc.

2008-06-20  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/doc/admin/bibupload-admin-guide.webdoc,
	modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py,

	Converted getfile.py URLs sent via emails to new /record/123/files/

	exploiting its features (authorization checking etc.)

2008-06-20  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_webinterface.py: Using
	HTTP_MOVED_TEMPORARILY when successful login (otherwise FireFox
	complains with HTTP_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT that it have to resend form
	information to a new URL.

2008-06-20  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/session.py: set_cookie set the cookie both

	function).

	Added trick to register in bibsched.log the exiting of a task.

2008-06-19  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL: Removed unneeded warning about the site-packages symlink
	creation on some OSes.	Reformulated the paragraph.  Removed
	trailing whitespace.

2008-06-19  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/testimport.py: Properly fixed the
	site-packages symlink advice.  (The problem on some OSes such as
	Debian Etch or SLC4 x86_64 was caused by existence of more than one
	'site-packages' directory in sys.path, with testimport using the
	first one and intbitset using the second one during 'make install'.
	Now testing and advising user to create symlinks for all
	site-packages directories.)

2008-06-19  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

2008-06-19  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Register_Referee_Decision.py:
	Bugfix.

2008-06-19  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Makefile.am: Added
	Register_Referee_Decision.py function.

2008-06-19  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	an approval request.

2008-06-19  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Register_Approval_Request.py:
	Small changes to functions that interact with the database layer.

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Register_Referee_Decision.py: A
	function whose job is to update the status of a document in the
	approvals database (sbmAPPROVALS), setting it to "approved" or
	"rejected" depending on the referee's decision.

2008-06-19  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/testimport.py: site-packages link is now
	created automatically before intbitset is installed.

2008-06-19  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/doc/admin/bibupload-admin-guide.webdoc:
	Improved FFT documentation by adding DELETE-FILE directive and some
	requirement e.g. for specifing multiple FFTs, for absolute paths,
	etc.

2008-06-19  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Completed support for
	DELETE-FILE FFT directive.

2008-06-18  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: When using FFT to rename a
	docname, take care of renaming the corresponding icon accordingly,
	if it exists.

2008-06-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_searcher.py: Removed
	unneeded import.  Fixed unknown exception catching.

2008-06-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/doc/hacking/miscutil-dbquery.webdoc: Updated

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Fixed run_sql_cached()
	calls by stating affected_tables explicitly.

2008-06-18  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_dblayer.py: Added function for
	retrieving the category of a document for which an approval request
	has been made: "get_approval_request_category".

2008-06-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py: Changed default values of
	run_sql_cached() in order to always look at the 'bibrec' table
	modification change as a safety net in case no affected_tables are
	specified.  This is a *much* safer default.  If some client code
	does not want to check any tables whatsoever, then it should
	specify '[]' explicitly.

	(Also, the function should rather use immutable argument, but that
	is for another commit.)

2008-06-18  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_indexer.py: better tag
	names. error messages. debugging

2008-05-29  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Stamp_Uploaded_Files.py: Changes
	made to the behaviour of this function: 1. Previously, a LaTeX
	template variable's value was FIRST tested for	  existence as a
	file in the current submission's working directory, and    if that
	file didn't exist, was used as a literal value to be inserted
	into the LaTeX template.     Now, however, ALL LaTeX template
	variable values will be considered as	  literal strings to be
	inserted into the LaTeX template, UNLESS they are     prefixed by
	"FILE:".     For example:      Literal:        'TITLE' : 'Invenio
	file stamping'	      In that case, the string "Invenio file
	stamping" will be substituted	     into the LaTeX template in
	place of the "TITLE" marker.	  File example:        'TITLE' :
	'FILE:DEMOTHE_TITLE'	    In that case, Stamp_Uploaded_Files will
	look for a file called	      'DEMOTHE_TITLE' in the current
	submission's working directory, and	   will substitute the
	value found in that file in place of the "TITLE"	marker in
	the LaTeX template. If however the file does not exist,        an
	empty string will be substituted for the "TITLE" marker.

	2. The other change is to the way that the latex-template-var
	"dictionary"	string is broken up and turned into a dictionary.
	Previously, a	 variable-value pair was split on all non-escaped
	colons. Now it simply	 splits on the first colon. This was
	necessary to allow the "FILE:"	  instruction.	   The implication
	for templates is that variable markers in the LaTeX	template
	cannot contain a colon. Values, however, can.

	modules/webstyle/lib/webstyle_templates.py,
	modules/webcomment/lib/webcomment_webinterface.py,

	webstyle_templates.detailed_record_container(..) into
	webstyle_templates.detailed_record_container_top(..) and
	webstyle_templates.detailed_record_container_bottom(..), so that it
	is possible to flush output faster to client, for example when
	displaying the Citations tab.
	websearch_templates.tmpl_detailed_record_citations(..) has been
	split in several tmpl_detailed_record_citations_*(..) functions
	also in order to flush results while they arrive.  The above means
	APIs change, so please revise your templates accordingly.

	* modules/bibformat/doc/admin/bibformat-admin-guide.webdoc,
	modules/bibformat/doc/hacking/bibformat-api.webdoc,
	modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine.py: Added new 5 and 6
	escaping mode, in order to keep more tags when washing

2008-05-20  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webinterface_handler.py: Removing _user_info

	modules/websession/lib/session.py,
	modules/websession/lib/websession_templates.py,
	modules/websession/lib/websession_webinterface.py: Finally fixed
	the session+redirection(+http password)(+not differentiate guest
	users) bug. If you have cookie that repesent a session this is sent
	to the user via req.headers_out. But redirection is based on
	raising an HTTP error, so the header that is sent is
	req.err_headers_out, which didn't contained the cookie. I'm now
	enforcing the cookie in err.headers_out and this works! It is
	finally safe to disable CFG_WEBSESSION_DIFFERENTIATE_BETWEEN_GUESTS
	and to enable the CERN hack to popup password for apache group when
	there's only one group related to a collection.

2008-05-19  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/lib/external_authentication_cern_wrapper.py: By
	debugging via register_exceptions it appear that at random times a
	'Connection reset by peer' error happend. Hence I try to solve this
	by opening the soap connection, doing the request and closing it.
	It can be slow, but safer.

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Added quick hacks for the
	journal index.	Here, phrases are stored together with the word
	terms in the same index, so we often have to go into 'bibwords'
	instead of into 'bibxxx' searching mode.  Also, as a consequence,
	the truncation feature was disabled for this index.

2008-05-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py: First implementation of
	the intelligent 'journal' index.  This is an index where terms are
	to be calculated from several subfields.  Later, the implementation
	can be improved, the journal index special feature can be made more
	nicely customizable, as this approach may be useful for other
	indexes, etc.

2008-05-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine_summarizer.py: For the
	Inspire site, do the cite summary only for 'citeable' papers.

	user to confirm that it is indeed the record that they had expected
	to work with and that the submission should continue.

2008-05-15  Radoslav Ivanov <radoslav.ivanov@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine_query_parser.py: Add journal
	to keywords translation and move regular expressions compilation
	outside the methods so they are compiled only once.

2008-05-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Do not print
	collection selection box in case there is only one collection to
	choose from.

2008-05-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webinterface.py: If there is only
	one collection defined, do not print its title on the page as it

2008-05-15  Travis C. Brooks <travis@slac.stanford.edu>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Replaced <br />
	with <div> in moreinfo links in brief html

	<br /> was causing too much spacing in inspire, <div> should
	accomplish the same thing but is stylable.  if reverting, consider
	leaving divs with if-testing for CFG_INSPIRE_SITE

2008-05-15  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_indexer.py: adds an extry in
	rnkCITATIONDATAEXT if the referred publication not found

2008-05-15  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/lib/webaccessadmin_lib.py: Fixed bug when
	viewing a role with no FireRole description caused an exception.

2008-05-15  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/lib/external_authentication_cern_wrapper.py:
	Workaround for bug in Python up to version 2.4.3. SSL connection
	may go in timeout when timeout is set, for no reason.

2008-05-15  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	999C5s reference to an existing record

2008-05-15  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_indexer.py: finds 999C5s
	references now with demobibdata

2008-05-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Fixed RSS url
	creation...

2008-05-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Correctly build RSS
	url when there is not argument but 'cc'.

2008-05-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webinterface.py: Do not try to
	cache URLs too long to be written to a file

2008-05-15  Radoslav Ivanov <radoslav.ivanov@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine_query_parser.py: SPIRES to
	Invenio syntax author search conversion

2008-05-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibtask.py: Cosmetic change WRT task status
	printing when a task is finished.

2008-05-15  Travis C. Brooks <travis@slac.stanford.edu>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine_query_parser_tests.py: MOre
	tests for SPIRES query parser..not currently passing

2008-05-15  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

2008-05-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibtask.py: Fixed comment typo.

2008-05-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibtaskex.py: Added
	task_sleep_now_if_required() so that we can demo and test task
	sleeping/stopping capabilities.

2008-05-15  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Fixed fix call.

2008-05-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_fulltext.py: When there is no
	file with doctype == "Main", we assume that the submission of this
	record makes no distinction between main and additional file. In
	that case, consider all the files equally as main files.

2008-05-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_searcher.py: Fixed comment
	typo.

2008-05-15  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_indexer.py: fixed range.

	summary output format to reproduce SPIRES's collection breakdown
	columns.  Refactored code to strictly separate business logic from
	output templates.

2008-05-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/css/cds.css: Added citesummary style.  Fixed a
	'Div' instance case.

2008-05-15  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiarchive_engine.py: oaiarchive to
	specify user oaiarchive when launching bibupload.

2008-05-14  Travis C. Brooks <travis@slac.stanford.edu>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine_query_parser_tests.py: Added
	Spires To Invenio Converter test cases

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Improved choice
	between hb and hd in openurl handler (based on the number of
	results).

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_word_indexer.py: Added
	register_exception in critical calculation to isolate
	DivisionByZero errors.

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibsched.py: Improved the log file. If
	lowercase l is pressed then realtime .log file is displayed (if
	viewed with less it can be even updated). If uppercase L is preseed
	.err file is displayed.

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibtask.py: Commented out resubmission of
	tasks when they fails. An admin should proof-check the failure and
	manually reinitialize.

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine.py,
	modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/shellutils.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Better closed mkstemp-created
	files.

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine.py,
	modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/shellutils.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Fixed mkstemp calls that
	leaved open files.

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_webinterface.py: Fixed a url
	redirection.

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/lib/external_authentication_cern.py,
	modules/webaccess/lib/external_authentication_cern_wrapper.py:
	Rewritten in order to be as fast and compact as possible (by not
	opening uselessly files).

2008-05-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	*
	modules/bibformat/etc/format_templates/Default_HTML_references.bft:
	Corrected no-references-found output message.

2008-05-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearchadminlib.py: Disable checking of
	the reference tab suitability because bfe_references.py may be too
	slow in case it is doing many lookups (as in Inspire).	We do not
	really need this checking anyway because we can disable tabs in
	WebSearch Admin on a collection-by-collection basis.  If we need
	this, then we should probably call bfo.fields('999') here that
	should be much faster than calling bfe_references.

2008-05-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_fulltext_mini.py: Fixed
	unclosed div

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_dblayer.py,
	modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_webinterface.py: Support for
	CFG_WEBSESSION_DIFFERENTIATE_BETWEEN_GUESTS and enforced inf_limit
	= 0 when inf_limit < 0 in list_public_baskets. (Bug found by
	GoogleBot :-).

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/session.py: Fixed small typo.

2008-05-14  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession.py,
	modules/websession/lib/session.py,
	modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: Fixed session bug! session was
	written in a cookie sent to headers_out. For re-reading it, it was
	read from headers_in. But this contained the cookie only on the
	next iteration. Hence trying to read the session more than 0 times
	on the first request was bringing each time new cookies, new
	sessions, new guests users. Now when the session is generated it is
	also saved in fictious way in headers_in.

2008-05-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Changed socket default timeout
	from 10s to 40s. This could maybe help in solving ssl timeout with
	external_authentication_cern

2008-05-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webinterface.py: Fixed
	redirections by explicitly specifing CFG_SITE_SECURE_URL when going
	to login. Otherwise what can happen is that when coming from a non
	https url webhandler redirect again to CFG_SITE_SECURE_URL and the
	referer is set to be the login url without http, creating the
	loop...

2008-05-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine_summarizer.py: Added
	CFG_CITESUMMARY_COLLECTIONS configuration.  Speeded up the
	collection lookup.

2008-05-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* config/invenio.conf: Moved CFG_CITESUMMARY_COLLECTIONS next to
	other cite summary configurations.

2008-05-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py: Added debugging code WRT
	encoding, just as for the bibrank word indexer.  Now the bad
	non-UTF-8 words and simply ignored and the indexing process goes
	on.  (And the admin is alerted about the record having the bad
	word.)

2008-05-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* config/invenio.conf: Differentiate between guests by default
	until the new behaviour is properly implemented.

2008-05-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Altered "Cited by"
	links to behave in the Google Scholar style.  (Showing explicitly
	how many records cite given record, or not showing the link at all
	if the given record is not cited.)

2008-05-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_searcher.py: Added new
	function get_cited_by_count() returning how many records cite given
	record.  Used in the search engine.

2008-05-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: Disabled isUserReferee
	algorithm because it's too slow in production environment.

2008-05-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py: Fixed a bug in run_sql_cached
	that returned cached query when affected_tables was changed within
	a second.

2008-05-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_word_indexer.py: Fixed debugging
	code.

2008-05-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_word_indexer.py: Added debugging code
	for spotting broken utf-8 handling.

2008-05-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession.py: Added
	CFG_WEBSESSION_DIFFERENTIATE_BETWEEN_GUESTS support (warning not
	still functional. Keep it set to 1)

2008-05-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: New apache password functions
	that not uses grep.

2008-05-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webinterface.py: Cleaned a bit
	redirections and added self to get_institute_pub_dict

2008-05-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webinterface_handler.py: Better format the
	profile output.

2008-05-12  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/session.py,
	modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: Fixing collect_user_info doing
	lots of useless analysis for guest users.

2008-05-12  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webmessage/lib/webmessage_dblayer.py: Fixed run_sql non
	correctly escaped.

2008-05-12  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py,
	modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_word_indexer.py: Trying to fixing
	select/update vs select/insert bug.

2008-05-12  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: Hack to cache user_info into
	mod_python request_object.

2008-05-12  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_webinterface.py:
	Disable CERN hack to redirect directly to authentication for apache
	group. It's broken!

2008-05-12  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webgroup_dblayer.py: Memoized all queries
	with FROM usergroup g, user_usergroup ug.

2008-05-12  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/oai_repository_webinterface.py: Remove ln
	parameter from input form in any case (webinterface_handler is
	adding it for language recognition, and currently fails at making
	an exception for the oai2d urls ending with '/', eg:
	CFG_SITE_URL/oai2d.py/?verb=Identify ) in order that OAI validation
	of input parameter does not fail.

2008-05-12  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webgroup_dblayer.py: Memoized get_groups
	function to give a bit of relieve to the system (it is called by
	collect_user_info).

2008-05-12  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webgroup.py: Added small check for
	IntegrityError in inserting a new group. It could be that because
	of concurrency while the group is inserted, another connection have
	already inserted it.

2008-05-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Use "collection"
	(=logical field name) instead of "980" (=physical field MARC tag)
	in the cite summary template search links.

2008-05-12  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Published column is
	now a link

2008-05-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_searcher.py: Use cached
	structures everywhere, not only in a few places.  (A proper cache
	invalidation still to be done.)  This speeds up the citation
	searches considerably.

2008-05-11  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py: Added
	CFG_RUN_SQL_WARNINGS_INTO_VERBOSE_EXCEPTIONS to turn warnings
	printed on screen into very verbouse exceptions, useful for
	debugging.

2008-05-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Prettified cite
	summary output: right justified numerical values, added thousands
	separator, updated link argument order, added sorting by the number
	of citations.

2008-05-11  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Reimplemented readfile with
	the old behaviour of silently returning empty string in case the
	file not exists. (useful for websubmit functions that expect files
	to not exists.)

2008-05-11  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* config/invenio.conf:
	added CFG_WEBSESSION_DIFFERENTIATE_BETWEEN_GUESTS config variable.

2008-05-11  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: added the forgotten
	table closing in request

2008-05-11  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: Added a hack in
	get_preferred_user_language to work with Yeti robot.

2008-05-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_templates.py: Fixed
	beg/prev/next/end arrow display in the list of public baskets.

2008-05-11  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py: get_word_tables now
	returns a list of tuples (index_id, index_tags) instead of a
	dictionary. In this way it is possible to respect the order of
	tables provided through command line.

2008-05-11  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Restored old behaviour of
	register_download: upper case extension without dot.

2008-05-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/bg.po, po/ca.po, po/cds-invenio.pot, po/cs.po, po/de.po,
	po/el.po, po/en.po, po/es.po, po/fr.po, po/hr.po, po/it.po,
	po/ja.po, po/no.po, po/pl.po, po/pt.po, po/ru.po, po/sk.po,
	po/sv.po, po/uk.po, po/zh_CN.po, po/zh_TW.po: New PO files for the
	internal release of v0.99.0.20080511.

2008-05-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/POTFILES.in: Added webdoc_tests.py.

2008-05-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac: Internal release of CDS Invenio v0.99.0.20080511.

2008-05-10  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Move_Files_to_Storage.py: In the
	following code:

	--- dummy, filename, extension = decompose_file(current_file) if
	extension:     extension = '.' + extension ---

	A period was added to the beginning of the extension. However, when
	the extension is returned from decompose_file, the period is
	already present at its start. It is therefore now only added if
	it's not there to begin with.

2008-05-10  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Added few new methods that
	are useful for the future bibdocfilecli.

2008-05-09  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibsched.py,
	modules/bibsched/lib/bibtask.py: New cleaner scheduler
	implementation. Should have less bugs and race conditions (in the
	priority handling) than previous version.

2008-05-09  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/css/cds.css: Reverted back from previous commit.
	Commented why this line is important

2008-05-09  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_indexer.py: added a config
	to turn off author/selfcite indexing

2008-05-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	used elsewhere.

2008-05-09  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabcreate.sql: index creation for missing
	citations table

2008-05-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_indexer.py: Speeded up
	print_record() call ~100 times by looking for match inside one
	bib99x table (instead of in all 100 bibXXx tables).  However, it
	may still be good to keep this 'prettifying' feature disabled.
	(The proper treatment here should be to go through 999 field
	instances one by one, so we should know about $s and $r we have,
	and we should not need any print_record() style of detection.)

2008-05-09  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_indexer.py: disabled "print
	record" for finding reference's 999c5s (too slow).

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibsched.py,
	modules/bibsched/lib/bibtask.py: After viewing a log, require to

	crashed bibsched. Cleaned progress information after rescheduling.
	Fixed a bug that brought the tasks to starvation situation.

2008-05-09  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/bibrank/etc/citation.cfg: configurable string for

	p=journalname, v=vol, c=pages

2008-05-09  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/webstyle/img/keep_sso_connection_alive.gif,
	modules/webstyle/lib/webpage.py: Added trick to keep SSO session
	alive during normal Invenio usage (Invenio use mostly http
	connections, but SSO needs https. Hence if the user is logged in
	and SSO is enabled a hidden gif is provided through https).

2008-05-09  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/bibrank/etc/citation.cfg: added publication journal pages
	volume tags

2008-05-09  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

2008-05-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_indexer.py: Write
	logging/profiling messages into log, not err stream.  Always use
	leading timestamp when printing.  Round printed time duration
	values.  Added "done fully" messages at the end of every started
	block (e.g. d_references_s etc).

2008-05-08  Radoslav Ivanov <radoslav.ivanov@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py,
	modules/websearch/lib/search_engine_query_parser.py: Plug SPIRES to

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py: Added more
	test cases for the special query terms such as U(1).  One fancy
	test "(U(1) OR SL(2,Z))" currently fails; it serves mostly as a
	reminder to strengthen the parens treatment in the future.

2008-05-08  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Added sanity check for
	search_pattern_parenthesised() in order not to invoke the
	parenthesised parser unless needed.  This fixes queries such as
	U(1).  Also, added printing of parenthesised parser output in the
	verbose mode.

2008-05-07  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Refactored
	search_special_fields() into search_unit_by_times_cited().  Removed
	unnecessary list/set conversions.  Plugged the function into
	search_unit() so that low-level API can use "cited:" index too.
	Fixed record universe detection so that "cited:" works in
	restricted collections too.

2008-05-07  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_searcher.py:
	get_records_with_num_cites() now returns intbitset, saving
	unnecessary list to set to list to hitset conversions.

2008-05-07  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: In the highest verbose
	mode and the search stage 1, do not print the full list of recIDs
	found for every basic search unit (since the list can be too long
	for queries like 'of'), but rather print an abbreviated form as
	provided by intbitset.

2008-05-07  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Fixed an ALTER TABLE statement in
	update-v0.99.0-tables.

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine_tests.py: Added test cases
	for parsing structured queries using existing, non-existing, and
	MARC-tag defined indexes.

	bugfixes, alerting of admin via email when queue stops, stopping
	the queue when bibupload is stopped.

2008-04-30  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine.py: Removed usage of

2008-04-04  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/webjournal/lib/webjournal_templates.py: In the alert
	interface, made the "subject" form field readonly.  This was done
	because no matter what the user puts in there, the value is later
	replaced by a value from one of the templates.	It's therefore

	* config/invenio.conf, modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py: Completed
	missing documentation for conf parameters.  Removed some obsoleted
	parameters.  Renamed some SQL parameters.

2008-03-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py: Prettified
	docstring of the export URL test.

2008-03-26  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOBOOcreate.tpl: Replaced call to CONF
	function with call to IFDEFP.

2008-03-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/demobibdata.xml: Removed fulltext
	description from FFT in demosite ("Fulltext" etc.)

2008-03-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/inveniocfg.py: Added --update-web-tests CLI
	option in order to replace URLs in web test cases with
	CFG_SITE_URL.  (Needed for Selenese 'open' commands in order to
	retain user sessions.)

2008-03-26  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOBOOcreate.tpl: Updated line for URL
	creation to take account of cases where there is no fulltext file
	so that an empty files line isn't created.

2008-03-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec.in: Added explicit default charset
	UTF-8 so that the dbexec client works well also on MySQL systems
	that are by default configured to use Latin-1 (say).  (You can
	check via SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "version"; SHOW VARIABLES LIKE
	"character%"; SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "collation%".)

2008-03-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py: Removed last spourious
	printed newline.

2008-03-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py: Clened fulltext indexing
	logging: if extraction method does not exist for a particular kind
	of format, say this only in verbose mode 2 (it's not a real error,
	e.g. .tiff files aren't supposed to be parsed as text). If a real
	error happens, though, this will be correctly printed (without
	spourious newlines) with default verbosity.

2008-03-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/inveniocfg.py: Added more charset variables
	in the output of '--detect-system-details'.  Useful for debugging.

2008-03-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webalert/lib/alert_engine.py: Fixed add_records_to_basket
	which lost synchro with webbasket development.	Current
	implementation uses webbasket_dblayer api, which is slower but
	safer.

2008-03-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/web/approve.py: Fixed access pw detection from
	URL now that language is passed in the URL too.

2008-03-26  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_templates.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_webinterface.py,
	modules/websubmit/web/approve.py,
	modules/websubmit/web/publiline.py: Better propagation of language
	in links. Changed "publication line" and "specific publication
	line" titles to "Approval and Refereeing Workflow" and "Specific
	Approval and Refereeing Workflow" (and made them localizable).

2008-03-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* AUTHORS: Added Joaquim.

2008-03-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/errorlib.py: Cleaned newlines and tabs.

2008-03-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/pt.po: Updated Portuguese translation, thanks to Joaquim
	Silvestre.

2008-03-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* NEWS: Compiled most important news for the forthcoming release of
	v0.99.0.

	* po/it.po: Updated Italian translation.

2008-03-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py: Removed notImplemented
	get_words_from_local_fulltext: it will be anyway reimplemented in
	the future in a different way by means of the centralized methods
	for extracting/caching streams of words from pdf/ps...

2008-03-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_webinterface.py: Fixed small bugs
	(CaMelCaSe & extracting string from exceptions).

2008-03-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_webinterface.py: Fixed
	update_data_user -> updateDataUser.

2008-03-26  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webinterface_handler.py,
	modules/bibharvest/lib/oai_repository_webinterface.py: Don't
	automatically add 'ln' parameter to URIs specified in
	'no_lang_recognition_uris' list.  OAI repository no longer needs to
	treat specifically this parameter.

2008-03-26  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/htmlutils.py: Updated 'nmtoken_from_string'
	docstring.

2008-03-26  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/webhelp/web/hacking/hacking.webdoc: Link to

	webstyle-internals webdoc file. Fixed typo in
	webstyle-webdoc-syntax.webdoc.

2008-03-26  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_templates.py: Propagate language
	through 2 additional links. Added 2 localizable strings.

2008-03-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/elmsubmit/lib/elmsubmit_EZEmail.py: Unified two

	conclusions to take into account the web test suite.

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webhelp/web/hacking/test-suite.webdoc: Added hints on web

	Also, fixed some '<code>' markup.

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/kwalitee.py: Added counting of web tests.

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL: Documented optional step 'inveniocfg --run-web-tests'.

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* THANKS: Added Ghostscript for borrowing the tiger test picture.

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

2008-03-25  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* po/fr.po: Updated translation.

2008-03-25  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webdoc.py: Changed webdoc source dir to
	CFG_PREFIX/lib/webdoc/invenio/

2008-03-25  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_templates.py: Added <label>
	tags here and there. Closed one <input> tag.

2008-03-25  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webinterface.py: Catch exception
	thrown when retrieving available output formats when mysql is
	stopped.

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql: Do not index URL fields (856*)
	in the "any field" global word index anymore.  This avoids the
	problem of searching for words that appear in the URL part too.
	This is also how the CERN instance of Invenio is configured.  Users
	wishing the old behaviour can use BibIndex Admin interface to
	change the "any field" field definition.

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/testutils_regression_tests.py: Fixed
	regression tests to take into account the new language passing
	policy.

2008-03-25  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/oai_repository.py,
	modules/bibharvest/lib/oai_repository_tests.py,
	modules/bibharvest/lib/oai_repository_webinterface.py: Raise a
	'badArgument' error when the request includes repeated arguments
	(section 3.6, OAI-PMH).

2008-03-25  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webinterface.py: Added 'hm', 'h'
	and 't' formats to the list of formats exported through
	/record/%i/export/ URLs.  Added corresponding regression tests.

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py: Added tests
	for search results page record grouping (rg).

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webinterface.py: Fetch saved user
	'rg' preferences only if not overridden via URL.

2008-03-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py: Made the
	sort test more robust by looking in title field only.  The original
	test was looking in 'any field' for word 'cern' which would match
	'foo.cern.ch' URLs, hence passing the test on CERN machines and
	failing elsewhere.

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/inveniocfg.py: Improved cosmetics regarding
	wait_for_user().

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/textutils.py: Always print the same
	confirmation message in wait_for_user().

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/testutils.py: Standardized 'Yes, I know!'
	confirmation message.  (Not using wait_for_user() here so that
	testutils could be imported eveywhere.)

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/textutils.py: wait_for_user() now requires
	typing the full phrase 'Yes, I know!' in order to eliminate
	potential accidents.  (Power users can still use the silent
	'--yes-i-know' command line option as before.)

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/web/Makefile.am,
	modules/websubmit/web/test_submit_book.html,
	modules/websubmit/web/test_submit_book_approval.html: Added web
	test for book submission and for checking approval rights of
	various demo users.  (Only rights are tested, no full approval or
	rejection procedure, since we don't have any tearDown() method to
	clean web tests after use to assure their repetitiveness.)

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/inveniocfg.py: When removing demo records,
	remove the whole 'data' directory, not only 'data/files', so that
	the submission counters etc get removed too.

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_templates.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_webinterface.py,
	modules/websubmit/web/publiline.py,
	modules/websubmit/web/yoursubmissions.py: Phased out unnecessary
	'images' argument of WebSubmit template functions.

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/POTFILES.in: Removed removed thumbmaker.in.

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac, modules/websubmit/bin/.cvsignore,
	modules/websubmit/bin/Makefile.am,
	modules/websubmit/bin/thumbmaker.in: Removed unused thumbmaker/PHP.

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* ChangeLog: Completed ChangeLog.

2008-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webhelp/web/hacking/test-suite.webdoc: Fixed typo, and

	This initial web test suite release includes an obligatory Ellis
	test search example, and, more importantly, tests for
	JavaScript-powered pages such as formatting many authors with
	show/hide links, submitting a demo article, a picture, and a poem.
	More tests to follow progressively.

	* configure.ac, modules/bibformat/bin/.cvsignore,
	modules/bibformat/bin/Makefile.am,
	modules/bibformat/bin/bibformat.in: Removed unneeded bibformat PHP
	CLI, fixing "neverending test case" issue on SLC4.

2008-03-13  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Restrict record similary
	search to 'cc' when 'cc' is specified.

2008-03-13  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/democfgdata.sql: I misspelled Dorian's
	surname - changed to gray. Sorry Dorian!

2008-03-13  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/democfgdata.sql: + Added new demo site user
	'Dorian Grey' (dorian.grey@cds.cern.ch; dorian).    He will be a
	referee for the Demo Book submission (DEMOBOO);  + Changed the
	email addresses of demo site users Jekyll and Hyde to use
	'@cds.cern.ch' instead of '@cern.ch'.

2008-03-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibtask.py: A workaround for some Python2.3
	systems, e.g. SLC4, where importing this file under
	Apache/mod_python environment causes an error.	A proper solution
	would be not to import bibtask.py as a dependency from web-related
	files, because we simply do not need it there...

2008-03-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py,
	modules/webstat/lib/webstat_webinterface.py: Cleaned
	page_not_authorized calls.

2008-03-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstat/lib/webstat_webinterface.py: Plugged checks for
	runwebstatadmin action authorization to webstat.

2008-03-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: When OpenURL does
	not correspond to an existing record, return a search for recid:-1,
	which already produces a nice "Requested record does not seems to
	exist." message.

2008-03-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstat/lib/webstat_webinterface.py: Forcing

2008-03-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: Registered exception when
	OperationalError during getUid.

2008-03-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webpage.py: uid is used by page function in
	order correctly build the page. It is sometimes not passed, but
	usually the req is passed by. Hence when no uid is passed, but req
	is, uid is set to getUid(req).

2008-03-12  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/inveniocfg.py: Fixed CFG_SITE_SECURE_URL
	name.

2008-03-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/inveniocfg.py: Added /stats URL to the

2008-03-10  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_file_stamper.py: Added quoting
	for all shell arguments. Crazy filenames should now be handled OK.

2008-03-10  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* po/it.po: Completed Italian translation.

2008-03-10  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	error.

2008-03-10  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_date.py: Fixed syntax. Default
	date format is '%d %B %Y' now instead of empty.

2008-03-10  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/errorlib.py: Reformatted output for
	registered exception sent via email.

2008-03-10  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/lib/webaccessadmin_lib.py: Lowered Demo Site
	output message.

2008-03-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/web/publiline.py: Deprecated the following 3
	functions:   + getInfo	 + getInPending   + getInAlice

	They basically search for details of an item that has at some point
	been submitted for referee-approval. getInPending looks for those
	details in the WebSubmit pending dir, whereas getInAlice looks for
	the details in the CDS Invenio repository.  getInfo was some glue
	that first called getInPending, then getInAlice if that failed to
	find anything.

	The way they were used was like this:

	try:	 (authors,title,sysno,newrn) = getInfo(doctype,categ,RN)
	except TypeError:     return _("Unable to display document.")

	It's ugly because the function(s) either returns a 4-element tuple
	or integer 0, catching a type-error to realise that it found
	nothing.

	Another problem (the major motivation for these changes) was that
	"getInPending" searches in the pending directory for the following
	hard-coded filenames:	+ TI   + TIF   + AU   + SN This basically
	means that the Invenio admin isn't free to call her form fields for
	title, etc as she likes, which isn't very nice. To get around this,
	I added 3 new functions:   + get_pending_item_details (replaces
	getInfo)   + get_brief_doc_details_from_pending (replaces
	getInPending)	+ get_brief_doc_details_from_repository (replaces
	getInAlice)

	The idea is that in the "submit" stage of the item, a WebSubmit
	function "Make_Dummy_MARC_XML_Record" should be called. This will
	create a MARC XML record containing the metadata. This record can
	then be parsed here, and fields like title, authors, etc extracted
	from it.

	For backward compatibility reasons, "get_pending_item_details"
	fails to find anything, the old "getInfo" is called. This should
	probably be removed though.

2008-03-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOBOO.tpl,
	modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTXT.tpl,
	modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTXTcreate.tpl,
	modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTXTmodify.tpl,
	modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOBOOcreate.tpl,
	modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOBOOmodify.tpl: First versions of the
	bibconvert configuration templates for the new "DEMOTXT" and
	"DEMOBOO" submissions.

2008-03-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTHE.tpl: Corrected the definition of
	the "day" field of the "DEMOTHE_DATE" element.

2008-03-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/etc/Makefile.am: Added the bibconvert
	configuration templates for record-creation in the new DEMOTXT and
	DEMOBOO submissions.

2008-03-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Print_Success_APP.py: Wanted to
	add a new parameter "decision_file", because the function
	previously looked for the hard-coded filename "decision", which
	meant that any referee's decision field on the form had to be
	called "decision".  Anyway, because the function was so short, and
	a mess, I decided to rewrite it. Sadly, it's still not perfect
	because it needs to make use of the global variable "rn" in the
	message.  Although it now has some exception-registering, it still
	needs work in the situation where it wasn't possible to read from
	the referee's decision file at all, yet should still return a
	message to be deisplayed in the user's browser (I'd have liked to
	have raised an InvenioWebSubmitFunctionWarning there, but that
	would prevent the return of a string for the user. So, this needs
	to be touched-up at some point . . . )

2008-03-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Send_APP_Mail.py: + Corrected a
	bug encountered when using a regexp to search in the report-
	number for category. (If <CATEG> wasn't in the string, i.e. there
	is no	category in the report number, a non-existent match-group
	was referenced.) + Added two new parameters:	 - decision_file
	The name of the file in which the referee's decision is stored.
	Previously, it looked for the hard-coded filename
	"decision", which	  meant that the form element for the
	referee's decision had to be called	    'decision'. Not nice -
	now the admin can call it whatever (s)he wants, 	e.g.
	"DEMOBOO_DESCN" in the ATLANTIS Demo Book submission.	      For
	backward-compatibility reasons, if no value is provided for
	the "decision_file" parameter, the function will look for
	"decision".	 - comments_file	 The name of the file in
	which the referee's comments are stored.	 Previously, it
	looked for the hard-coded filename "COM", which 	meant that
	the form element for the referee's comments had to be called
	"COM". Not nice - now the admin can call it whatever (s)he wants,
	e.g. "DEMOBOO_COMNT" in the ATLANTIS Demo Book submission.
	For backward-compatibility reasons, if no value is provided
	for	    the "comments_file" parameter, the function will look
	for "COM".

2008-03-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/democfgdata.sql: Added the configuration
	information for two new demo submissions:   + "Demo Textual
	Document Submission" (DEMOTXT);   + "Demo Book Submission
	(Refereed)" (DEMOBOO);

2008-03-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql: + Added "decision_file"
	parameter to functions "Update_Approval_DB",   "Send_APP_Mail" and
	"Print_Success_APP".  + Added "comments_file" parameter to function
	"Send_APP_Mail".

2008-03-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Update_Approval_DB.py: Fixed a
	variable-name error.

2008-03-07  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql: Added details of the
	"Make_Dummy_MARC_XML_Record" function.

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Makefile.am: Added the
	Make_Dummy_MARC_XML_Record.py function

2008-03-07  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Make_Dummy_MARC_XML_Record.py:
	First version of a function to make a 'dummy' MARC XML record.
	This record could have various uses later during a submission (e.g.
	creating a preview with bibconvert, enabling the publiline system
	to identify fields like title without having to know the filenames
	of these fields, etc.)

2008-03-07  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Send_Approval_Request.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Update_Approval_DB.py: Fixed some
	bad handling of groups in regexp searches.

2008-03-07  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_templates.py: Fixed a bug:
	contcatenation of str and long types when moving between submission
	pages with the number-tabs at the top of the pages.

2008-03-07  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Added check for existence of
	md5sum (e.g. it doesn't exist on MacOS X).

	* modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTH.tpl,
	modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTHcreate.tpl,
	modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTHmodify.tpl: The Demo Thesis submission
	[DEMOTH] was renamed to [DEMOTHE].  Accordingly, these templates
	were also renamed.

2008-03-06  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTHE.tpl,
	modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTHEcreate.tpl,
	modules/websubmit/etc/DEMOTHEmodify.tpl: The bibconvert
	configuration templates used for record-creation in the Demo Thesis

2008-03-06  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/democfgdata.sql: + Renaming of 'DEMOTH' to
	'DEMOTHE'; Changed a couple of fieldnames; Changed   the
	description of the DEMOTHE document type to reflect the fact that
	it   is the simplest of the demo submissions.

2008-03-06  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine.py,
	modules/bibformat/etc/format_templates/Default_HTML_actions.bft,
	modules/bibformat/etc/format_templates/Default_HTML_files.bft:
	Translates _(text)_ in format templates.

2008-03-06  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/democfgdata.sql: Added the details of the
	new `Demo Thesis' (DEMOTH) submission. Dropped the `THESIS'
	category of document from the `TEXT' and `RTEXT' submissions
	because it's no longer needed.

2008-03-06  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/etc/Makefile.am: Added details of
	DEMOTHmodify.tpl

	naming bug (with Sam).

2008-03-05  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: collect_user_info allows now a
	dictionary as input. It will consider it as a previous call to
	collect_user_info and will just return. (useful for build function
	around collect_user_info that should work with uid, user_info or
	req).

2008-03-05  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

2008-03-05  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiarchive_engine.py: Removed fragile SQL
	code. Thanks to Gregory Favre (EPFL).

2008-03-04  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	site frome core, and cleaned authorization information.

2008-02-25  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/lib/access_control_admin.py: Hardcode
	SUPERADMINROLE super powers. No more in database, this helps in
	keeping everything synchronized.

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Added CERN-only dirty
	hack for making base 29 dummy/deleted records visible to library
	approvers.  A more elegant solution is to be implemented later,
	since the functionality is potentially interesting to any Invenio
	lambda site too.

2008-02-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* RELEASE-NOTES: Moved check-custom-templates from INSTALL file.

2008-02-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/textutils.py: Added wait_for_user() that is
	useful for interactive CLI programs.  Slightly emended
	wrap_text_in_a_box().  More refactoring needed, e.g.
	make_conclusion() is but a special case of wrap_text_in_a_box().

2008-02-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/bin/Makefile.am,
	modules/webaccess/bin/Makefile.am: Removed some chmodding that is

	advise to check-custom-templates as it belongs to upgrade path
	only.  Do not call inveniocfg upon installing.	Do not manipulate
	localstate directory permissions.  Phased out 'create-table' and
	friends that are now being performed via 'inveniocfg' after basic
	installation.

2008-02-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac, modules/webhelp/web/hacking/test-suite.webdoc:
	Phased out 'make create-tables' in the documentation in profit of
	'inveniocfg --create-tables' and friends.

	* modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec.in, modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py:
	Used the same demo values for WEBURL and DB credentials as in
	invenio.conf.

2008-02-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	in touch() last commit. Addeded very detailed logging to the
	migration_kit, in order to spot any possible issue.

2008-02-22  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py: Update bibrec modification
	time when bibdoc is modified. NOTE: are there any side issues to
	this? Does future MARCXML versioning breaks?

2008-02-22  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat.py: Removed column headers in the
	Excel format, since it is not flexible enough to create formats
	with a different number of columns.  To be moved later to
	bibformat_templates.py if needed.

2008-02-21  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/xmlmarc2textmarclib.py: Moved the line "from
	__future__ import generators" to be the first statement  of the
	file in order to correct a syntax error in Python 2.5.1, which
	complained that from __future__ imports had to be at the beginning
	of the	file.

2008-02-20  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/css/cds.css: Prevent wrapping of links in header

2008-02-19  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_file_stamper.py: Plenty of
	refactoring and updates to the script. There are now 3 stamping
	options:    + first	-> stamp only the first page of the file;
	+ all	     -> stamp all pages of the file;	+ coverpage -> add
	a separate cover page to the file;

2008-02-19  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_templates.py: Fixed resizing of
	documentation frame inside template editor.

2008-02-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac: Removed AC_PREFIX_DEFAULT call now that we test for
	prefix explicitly.

2008-02-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac: Added explicit prefix test so that the
	localstatedir hack works.  (It could give NONE otherwise.)

2008-02-17  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL: Updated sections on OS, on the configure parameters, and
	on checking style templates.  (The last one should be moved into
	upgrade guide.)

2008-02-17  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac: Added AC_PREFIX_DEFAULT so that we shall install
	into /opt/cds-invenio by default.  "./configure" can now be called
	without any arguments.

2008-02-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Updated jsmath box cosmetics.

2008-02-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	author affilitions in demo records changed the order in search
	responses - adjusted

2008-02-15  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket.py,
	modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_regression_tests.py: Fixed web
	interface bug in WebBasket when not selecting a topic, but creating
	a new one. Corrected regression tests.

2008-02-15  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_regression_tests.py: changed the
	text cases to include author affiliations as added to demobibdata

2008-02-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure-tests.py: Severed test for minimal MySQLdb version.
	Added test for minimal Stemmer version.  Also, minor cosmetic
	changes.

2008-02-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	install-tests.py, config/invenio-autotools.conf.in,
	config/invenio.conf, modules/elmsubmit/etc/elmsubmit.cfg.in,
	modules/miscutil/bin/.cvsignore, modules/miscutil/bin/Makefile.am,
	modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec.in, modules/miscutil/bin/dbtest.in,
	modules/miscutil/lib/.cvsignore, modules/miscutil/lib/Makefile.am,
	modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py.in,
	modules/miscutil/lib/inveniocfg.py: Moved important runtime
	parameters (URLs, DB credentials) from configure options into
	invenio.conf.  This permits to install Invenio without thinking too
	much about them in advance, and to change them later after initial
	demo tests are successful, without having to reinstall.  Enriched
	inveniocfg tool with options to update necessary files (such as
	dbquery.py) in situ, keeping one backup file (.OLD).

2008-02-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/doc/admin/bibupload-admin-guide.webdoc: Fixed
	doc concerning REVERT functionality.

2008-02-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Call inveniocfg --generate-config-py after
	installation.  Adapted inveniocfg --reset-* calls.

2008-02-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/inveniocfg.py: Do not require conf files as
	arguments anymore; rather, look for them in etcdir.  When doing
	--generate-config-py, do not emit config.py contents anymore;
	rather edit the file on the spot in libdir, making a backup first.
	This permits to rerun inveniocfg more conveniently during runtime.

2008-02-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/Makefile.am: Do not generate config.py
	during make anymore.  It will be generated later during make
	install by inveniocfg.

	* modules/websubmit/lib/bibdocfile.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_webinterface.py,
	modules/bibupload/doc/admin/bibupload-admin-guide.webdoc,
	modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py,
	modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload_regression_tests.py: Formalized
	__str__() method of BibRecDocs, BibDoc, BibDocFile.  Fixed sorting
	of 8564 rows in MARC produced by BibUpload.  Added revert method to
	bibdoc, in order to revert to old revision.  Fixed deleting bibdoc,
	by renaming to DELETED-datetime-docname, so that creating a bibdoc
	called docname is then possible.  Fixed undelete to work with new
	delete algorithm Fixed websubmit file-non-existing error-box which
	was raising an exception.  Added $v e REVERT command to FFT in
	order to exploit revert method of bibdoc.  Added regression test
	for testing --replace, REVERT and __str__

2008-02-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/demobibdata.xml: added second affiliation
	for INFN researchers who have it

2008-02-14  Marko Niinimaki <manzikki@gmail.com>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/demobibdata.xml: added author affiliations.
	some of them are incomplete so that the records can be used as test
	material for a script that finds canonical forms of institute names

2008-02-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/web/admin/bibformatadmin.py: Removed reference
	to migration kit.

2008-02-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformatadminlib.py: Fixed a bug that
	would prevent listing the format templates and output formats when
	a file was being edited at the same time.

2008-02-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webdoc.py: Display only webdoc files in
	index pages.

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibdocadmin.py,
	modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Changed behaviour of Bibupload
	WRT FFT when --replace is used. It now behaves as in
	replace_or_insert mode, i.e. adding a revision if the doc already
	exists otherwise appending a format. In this way it can work with
	BibEdit (which uses replace by default).

2008-02-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec.in: Use single quotes instead of
	double quotes for DB parameters.  Useful if dbpass contains chars
	such as dollar.

	* config.nice.in: Added --with-mysql option.  Quoted --with-dbpass
	option.

	parameter "user_info" (defaulting to None) to definition of
	WebSubmit functions.   "user_info" should be a dictionary
	containing information about the logged-   in user (e.g. email
	address, user id, preferences, etc.) Functions should	be able to
	make use of this information.

2008-02-11  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: In
	'print_function_calls', added the framework to allow WebSubmit
	functions  to be called with 'user_info' (a dictionary of user
	information) as a 4th  keyword argument.   This is the new model
	for WebSubmit functions. They should now be created   and called
	with four parameters, thus a declaration like this:	def
	Function_Name(parameters, curdir, form, user_info):

	 WebSubmit will first attempt to call the function like this:
	   function(parameters=parameters,
		    curdir=curdir,
		    form=form,
		    user_info=user_info)
	 If the function is a legacy function (i.e. doesn't accept
	user_info),
	 a TypeError will be raised when WebSubmit attempts to call it.
	WebSubmit
	 will therefore try once more to call it without user_info, like
	this:
	   function(parameters=parameters,
		    curdir=curdir,
		    form=form)

	 So, from now on, all new WebSubmit functions should defined with
	the 4th
	 user_info parameter.

2008-02-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_external_collections_searcher.py:

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webstyle_templates.py: Fixed a bug: An

	found in sys.exc_info()[0] and sys.exc_info()[1]. These  values are
	not strings - they are in fact a type and an object respectively.
	They have therefore been cast to strings.

	* modules/miscutil/bin/dbtest.in: Changed dbtest so that it does
	not depend on having tables around anymore.  The tables will be
	explicitly created later during 'make create-tables' step.  This

	configure which tags do contain emails of user that should be
	authorized to always view a record.

	even if they were not authorized to the collection to which the
	record belonged. Enriched authorization WRT restricted documents by
	letting their submitters to display them even when they're not

	coded properly (and does not seem to be used either).  This commit
	fixes problems with newer mod_pythons (e.g. 3.3.1) where
	wash_urlargd() would return a list of Field objects if the cast to
	string is not explicit, unlike previous mod_python versions (e.g.
	3.1.3) that returned list of strings directly.	Humph.

	engine API with a possibility to pass full datetime values d1, d2
	in the format "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss" to retrieve records created or
	modified in a certain time interval.  Useful e.g. for OAI interface
	client code.  Note that d1, d2 take precedence over (d1y, d1m,
	d1d), (d2y, d2m, d2d) tuples if they exist.  Added some more test
	cases.

	drop-tables).  Knowledgeable people can use "FORCE=yes make

	when removing demo records.

2007-11-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/fulltext_files_migration_kit.py: Migration
	kit for converting the filesystem structure from file.py to
	docfile.py. Docfile.py filesystem structure is a stricter subset of
	file.py filesystem. Extensions of files are all lower case. Files
	are all named after the corresponding bibdoc. Thus there can't
	exist more than one file with the same format and version for the
	same bibdoc. The script take care of creating a bibdoc with a
	similar name in order to host the conflicting bibdoc.

2007-11-26  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/docfile.py: New implementation of file.py.
	This module should render file.py deprecated.  It has a cleaner api
	for handling fulltext files, is more robust and coherent. Some
	restriction have been implemented on how to import file on the
	filesystem. For this a migration kit will be implemented.

	True.  When a restricted collection is searched for, and it exists
	one and only apache-password enabled role to access this
	collection, the user is automatically prompted for apache-password
	like in the previous release, while if there's more of one
	apache-password enabled role, those roles are proposed, but the
	login dialog will be hidden.

2007-11-22  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	.../admin/bibupload/guide.html#3.5 specs.

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Renamed functions
	(get_first_reference_line_numeration_marker_patterns_via_brackets,..via_dots
	and ..via_numbers. The 2 latter are tried ONLY when the
	get_first_reference_line_numeration_marker_patterns_via_brackets
	fails to find any reference section, and ..via_numbers only if
	...via_dots fails. Whilst these additional searches are useful they
	find a certain amount of rubbish. The variable how_found_start
	indicates the method of finding the reference section (0=by title,
	1 no title via_brackets, 2 no title via_dots and 3 no title
	via_numbers (the weakest..). Then if NO reports and NO journal
	titles are found and how_found_start > 2; all results (very often
	complete nonsense in terms of references) are discarded. This
	functionality was actually introduced in the previous version -
	this version is only about better naming conventions..

	Safari browser under Mac OS X was used (tested with 10.4).     In
	order to fix this issue, enctype="multipart/form-data" was added
	into the form declaration in the tmpl_page_interface function
	(Safari     seems to need it and wasn't happy just to use the
	JavaScript dynamic     insertion of this same form attribute in
	script tags).

	StandardError when something goes wrong.  -Updated other methods
	which instanciate BibDoc object in order to catch error when it
	cannot be instantiated.  -FIXME: no I18N of error messages in this
	file.

	our system, because they have already been recognized by an
	external entity that we trust. If there's no local authentication
	and CFG_ACCESS_CONTROL_LEVEL_ACCOUNTS is set two 2 or more, before
	this fixing the user wasn't able to enter CDS Invenio. (Found
	thanks to Greg).

	migrated with some tricks to firerole * documentation for firerole
	* cleaned conflicts between marshal/cPickle everywhere * new
	abstract object for generic queries (for now used only by the new
	resticted_collection system, code is ready but not used for the
	other Invenio caches) * dropped check for producing the links for
	administration in the upper-right corner, needed to resolv circular
	import and avoid bad tricks * enhanced webaccessadmin cli to use
	regular authorization system, and to compile all the firerole

	for the JOINMULTILINES function, and for the ^ notation.

2007-05-04  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/lib/bibconvert.py: Added a new bibconver
	formatting function "JOINMULTILINES".  It is used to join a
	multiline string into a single line.  The function interface is:
	JOINMULTILINES(prefix,suffix) For each segment resulting from the
	split on newline, "prefix" will be appended to the front and
	"suffix" will be appended to the end.  Example of calling:   For
	the field XX with the value:	Test	Case, A   And the function
	call:	 <:XX^::XX::JOINMULTILINES(<subfield
	code="a">,</subfield>):>   The results would be:    <subfield
	code="a">Test</subfield><subfield code="a">Case, A</subfield>

	Also added a new notation "^" to source fields, e.g.:
	<:XX^::XX:> It is similar to the notation "*" which is used to
	signify repeating source fields.  However, "^" is used to tell
	bibconvert to preserve the newlines in the source field so that
	they can be processed by functions such as "JOINMULTILINES", above.

2007-05-03  Jan Brice Krause <jan.brice.krause@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/etc/oaiarxiv2marcxml.xsl: Added "Comments: " a

	lead to the directory listing exposure in case the Indexes option
	was up.  Thanks to Ferran Jorba for reporting the problem.

2007-05-02  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/xmlmarc2textmarclib.py: Removed newlines from

	records with DUMMY collection identifier when generating list of
	records belonging to a collection.

2007-04-30  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Corrected bugs in handling of
	URLs. URLs are now processed BEFORE the punctuation in the line is
	treated because the colon (:) was lost which made it difficult to
	correctly match URLs with a port number after the machine address.

2007-04-30  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/doc/admin/guide.html.wml: Updated the guide to
	reflect last changes needed to support SSO. (basically, adding
	req=None as the last parameter of every method of an authentication
	plugin).

2007-04-27  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

2007-04-27  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py,
	modules/webstyle/css/cds.css,
	modules/webstyle/img/external-icon-light-8x8.gif: Modified external
	search box to (1) link to external website using "external" icon
	and (2) make checkboxes labels as real labels instead of links to
	external websites.

2007-04-27  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmitadmin_templates.py: Changed the
	method by which the form allowing a user to edit a WebSubmit
	function 'parameter file' is submitted, from 'get' to 'post', after
	errors due to over-sized URLs were encountered.

2007-04-26  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Modification of the regexp
	patterns used to identify the numeration that accompanies a Journal
	title citation in order to fix a bug that could occur under certain
	conditions:  + Under certain conditions, certain prerint
	report-numbers were found to	have been corrupted. As an example,
	consider the following line:	H.Aoyama, N.Nakayama, M.Sato,
	T.Tanaka 2001 hep-th/0107048, 0108124.

	   It was found that refextract transformed it into:
	   H.Aoyama, N.Nakayama, M.Sato, T.Tanaka 2001 hep-th/ : 0107048
	(1081) 0 24.

	   This was due to a problem in the regexp patterns - the
	constraints on the
	   recognition of the "volume" were not strict enough. In this
	revision,
	   these search constraints have been tightened (around the volume
	   recognition) so that volumes will not be matched against "/", or
	even
	   against other digits in order to prevent the corrumption of such
	data.

2007-04-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/democfgdata.sql.wml: Removed Google Books,
	Google Scholar and Google Web as searchable external collections
	due to the Google's red light on the subject.

2007-04-26  Jan Brice Krause <jan.brice.krause@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/etc/oaiarxiv2marcxml.xsl: Change OAI ID MARC
	filed from 0248d to 035 9,a

2007-04-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload_config.py: Changed
	CFG_BIBUPLOAD_EXTERNAL_OAIID_TAG to 035__a that is an independent
	field from CFG_OAI_ID_FIELD.  Helps in not intervening with
	oaiarchive-generated OAI IDs.

2007-04-25  Jan Brice Krause <jan.brice.krause@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/etc/oaiarxiv2marcxml.xsl: Fixed a misspelling

2007-04-25  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Altered the pattern used to
	recognise "IBID" instances that do not actually contain the word
	"IBID". Added support for matching on the term " and " directly
	before a citation's recognised/tagged "numeration".

2007-04-25  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Removed the import of the now
	unused 'CFG_REFEXTRACT_MARKER_CLOSING_URL' config variable.

2007-04-25  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract_config.py: Removed the now unused
	'CFG_REFEXTRACT_MARKER_CLOSING_URL' config variable.

2007-04-25  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Fixed a bug in the handling of
	URLs. Previously, URLs could be corrupted during the "journal
	title" recognition phase. Now, URLs are actually removed from the
	line before the title and report-number recognition phases, which
	guarantees that their components will never be matched against the
	KB seek terms.

2007-04-24  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Corrected 2 bugs in the
	function "move_tagged_series_into_tagged_title":  * Previously, the
	series could be lost under certain conditions. Now it will
	always be added into the title.   * Previously, the series was
	added into the title, separated by "., ". E.g.	   "Phys. Rev., B".
	Now, the comma has been dropped, meaning that the     example above
	will be output as "Phys. Rev. B".

2007-04-24  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: In certain papers, " bf "
	appears just before the volume of a cited item. It is believed that
	this is a mistyped TeX command for making the volume "bold" in the
	paper.	The line may look something like this after numeration has
	been recognised: M. Bauer, B. Stech, M. Wirbel, Z. Phys. bf C :
	<cds.VOL>34</cds.VOL> <cds.YR>(1987)</cds.YR> <cds.PG>103</cds.PG>
	The " bf " stops the title from being correctly linked with its
	series and/or numeration and thus breaks the citation.	Added a
	pattern to recognise this situation and to strip out the " bf "
	after the numeration-recognition pass, so that citations are not
	missed because of this sitatuation.

2007-04-24  Jan Brice Krause <jan.brice.krause@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/etc/oaiarxiv2marcxml.xsl: Corrected 695
	processing. Added 65017 multiple subjects (first in $$a, others in

2007-04-23  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Removed tagging of series
	information as it conflicted with the KB in certain cases when
	searching for titles; Added checking to account for trailing hyphen
	in certain titles; Moved the addition of GOOD->Good titles to take
	place AFTER all other titles had been read in from the KB. This
	way, the explicit BAD terms in the KB alway have priority over bad
	terms generated from Good terms.

2007-04-23  Jan Brice Krause <jan.brice.krause@cern.ch>

	function useful for retrieving all the groups of a uid.

2007-04-20  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: When creating the knowledge
	base of Journal titles:   * Enforced sorting of search terms by
	string length longest->shortest.    * Now adding all
	"replace-terms" (i.e. good forms of Journal titles) as
	"search-terms". This removes the need to enter all "good" Journal
	titles	    into the KB as seek phrases. (i.e. no need for
	"GOOD---Good").

2007-04-20  Jan Brice Krause <jan.brice.krause@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/etc/oaiarxiv2marcxml.xsl: Adaptet to new arXiv

	collection and field names) contributed by Kam-ming Ku.  The PO
	files to be translated later.

2007-04-12  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/lib/bibconvert.py: Added a new bibconver
	formatting function "IFDEFP".  It is like a mixture of DEFP (which
	signals that a line should always be printed) and CONF (which
	prints a line based upon whether a condition met by the contents of
	another field variable is met).  So, this function IFDEFP is used
	on constant lines to say that they should be printed based upon the
	contents of another field.  E.g. given the following line:
	690C::REP(EOL,)::IFDEFP(comboYEL,BOOK,1)---<datafield tag="690"
	ind1="C" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">BOOK</subfield></datafield>

	We want to print the line if the "comboYEL" field contains "BOOK",
	otherwise we don't want to print it.  This is achieved by using
	"IFDEFP". If the line had contained variables, "CONF" would have
	been used instead.  The arguments to IFDEFP are the same as with
	CONF. The first parameter is the name of the field on which the
	decision is to be made. The second parameter is the value that is
	to be tested against. The third parameter takes a value of "1" or
	"0": 1 = print the line if the field contains the value; 0 = print
	the line if the field does NOT contain the value.

2007-04-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number to v0.92.1.20070412.

	* modules/bibharvest/bin/oaiarchive.in,
	modules/bibharvest/doc/admin/guide.html.wml,
	modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiarchive_engine.py: Removed documentation
	about non-existing option from oaiarchive help and guide.

2007-03-29  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: + Fixed a bug when looking for
	the end of the references section. Previously, there was a regexp
	searching for a certain pattern of digits (something that occurs
	sometimes when the figures/tables are converted to text).
	Unfotunately, in certain cases, the regexp search was horribly long
	- infinite, maybe! It was fixed by removing the regexp pattern and
	using some methods of the string object, such as replace, is_digit,
	etc. Additionally, this also seems to have improved the recognition
	of the end of a reference section.  + To identify different pages
	of a PDF document, refextract was looking for  a page-break
	character (\\f) on its own line because pdftotext always put this
	character in a line of its own. However, in a new version of this
	tool (3.01 onwards?), this character is not necessarily in its own
	line. This caused some problems when searching for headers/footers,
	etc. Therefore, when text from pdftotext is read-in by refextract,
	it now adds this char into its own line, should it come at the
	start of a line; + Added a new numeration-recognition pattern (and
	subsequent handling code) that is used when transforming a tagged
	citation line into MARC XML. The new pattern looks for tagged
	numeration, and is applied immediately after a title + numeration
	pattern has been applied. This handles IBIDs that do not actually
	use the word "IBID". E.g.: <cds.TITLE>J. Phys. A</cds.TITLE> :
	<cds.VOL>31</cds.VOL> <cds.YR>(1998) </cds.YR>
	<cds.PG>2391</cds.PG>; : <cds.VOL>32</cds.VOL> <cds.YR>(1999)
	</cds.YR> <cds.PG>6119</cds.PG>.  The 2nd group of numeration
	clearly belongs with the title - the author has simply missed out
	the title. Previously reference this would have been missed.  Now
	however, it will be recognised;

2007-03-29  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: Added two checks in
	order to make websumbit happy with latest mod_python.

2007-03-29  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Create_Modify_Interface.py: If
	nothing is selected in the "change" select list, all the options of
	the "change" element are picked from the database to create the
	modify interface.  It allows to skip the selection interface.

2007-03-22  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webalert/lib/webalert_webinterface.py: Do not use
	explicit user ID parameter in the remove alert functionality.

2007-03-22  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webalert/lib/webalert_templates.py: Do no pass idu (id of

	InvenioWebSearchUnknownCollectionError.

2007-03-21  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: Added checking of a
	submission's status into the functions that create the Web forms
	and process the submitted data. If the submission's status is set
	to 'finished', WebSubmit will not continue to process the
	submission. Instead, it will display a message saying that the
	submission has been completed, providing a link to the submission
	homepage of the doctype that was last submitted.  This corrects a
	bug that was encoutered when users used their browser's back button
	to return the Web Form to start a new submission. Such an action
	could lead to data loss problems and unstable behaviour during the
	submission.  This has now been prevented.

2007-03-21  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/doc/admin/guide.html.wml: Added documentation

2007-03-20  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_config.py: Replaced
	'functionError' and 'functionStop' exceptions (as raised by
	WebSubmit functions and handled in WebSubmit core) with
	'InvenioWebSubmitFunctionError' and 'InvenioWebSubmitFunctionStop'
	exceptions; Updated the exception 'InvenioWebSubmitFunctionWarning'
	to follow the same structure (with a value attribute).

2007-03-20  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: Replaced the
	exceptions "functionError" and "functionStop" (as raised by
	WebSubmit functions and handled in WebSubmit core) with the
	better-named "InvenioWebSubmitFunctionStop" and
	"InvenioWebSubmitFunctionStop" exceptions.

2007-03-20  Diane Berkovits <diane.berkovits@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_templates.py: Display "main menu"
	link even if the submission is not "finished".	CiVS: Committing in
	.

2007-03-19  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: Fixed a bug
	encountered when a 'functionStop' exception was raised. Previously,
	this stopped the functions from continuing to execute, but the code
	proposing the 'next action' and updating the submission as finished
	still executed. This meant that a function could be logged as
	finished in the submission log table, even when it wasn't. This
	code has now been tucked into an 'else' clause in the try->except
	statement, so it will only be executed if the functions finish
	without raising a functionStop exception. Submissions will not,
	therefore, be wrongly marked as finished in the log.

2007-03-19  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: Removed some unused
	functions (get_report_number, set_report_number, get_sysno,
	set_sysno).

2007-03-17  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Fixed a bug that occurred when
	matching report-numbers: the wrong length of the match was taken -
	it took the whole match (which included a leading non-word
	character), rather than the length of the desired reportnum match.
	This has been corrected; Modifications by Tony: added option to
	write statistics about matched KB titles to a file;

2007-03-16  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: Added docstrings to
	module and major business-logic functions.

2007-03-16  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/etc/refextract-report-numbers.kb: Removed a
	'dummy' pattern.

2007-03-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_record_sorter.py: Immunized
	is_method_valid() from collection existence problems.

2007-03-15  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Added a dictionary to keep a
	count of all periodical titles found in reference lines during an
	extraction job. (This dictionary of totals could be used to produce
	some kind of statistic about most commonly found titles, for
	example.)

2007-03-15  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/xmlmarc2textmarclib.py: * Fixed display of
	empty indicators in TEXT-MARC mode - they are now   replaced by an
	underscore instead of a space; * Fixed Display of empty ind1 when
	ind2 is not empty in ALEPH-MARC   mode. Previously, ind1 would be a
	space - now it is an underscore; * Fixed handling of empty
	indicators in MARC XML fields - now handles   either spaces or
	empty strings (e.g.: ind1=\" \" or ind1=\"\"); * Fixed issue
	concerning the order of datafields and subfields in the   record:
	previously both datafields and subfields were orderd alpha-
	numerically in the resulting MARC record - now the order in which
	they   occurred in the XML MARC record is respected; * Added config
	variable 'CFG_ORGANIZATION_IDENTIFIER' that should contain   the
	identifer of the organization to which the 001 field value belongs
	(set as SzGeCERN for CERN sites - other sites should configure
	their own   value for this). The 003 field is now added to
	ALEPH-MARC 'insert' and   'replace' records, and dropped from all
	other ALEPH-MARC records. Its	value from the XML MARC record is
	preserved in TEXT-MARC mode; * Fixed a bug in ALEPH-MARC 'insert'
	mode. Previously the SYS (970__a) that	 was present in the XML
	MARC record was taken as the SYS for the record   and put into the
	001 field of the resulting ALEPH record. This was wrong.    Now,
	when creating an ALEPH insert record, 970 is dropped from the XML
	record, and a random sysno is generated for the new ALEPH record.
	No 001	  is added to the record - ALEPH will choose its own SYS
	and add a 001	 automatically.  * Changed the "m" (modify) option
	of --aleph-mode to be "c" (correct); * Other refactoring and
	code-cleaning after pylint;

2007-03-15  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/bin/xmlmarc2textmarc.in: Refactoring: moved
	'main' function into 'xmlmarc2textmarclib.py'.

2007-03-15  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/urlutils.py: Replace "&" by "&amp;" after

	standard compliance issues.  Thanks to Michael Ehrismann for
	reporting the problem.

2007-03-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* ChangeLog: Typo in the release year fixed, thanks to Greg.

2007-03-13  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/doc/admin/guide.html.wml: Fixed guide because
	WML is thinking that __init__( means __init_ and intenationalize
	what follow _( .

2007-03-13  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_dblayer.py: Removed the reference

2007-03-08  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/lib/external_authentication_cern.py: Restored

2007-03-06  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Updated title-numeration
	patterns: when searching for 'volume', the word 'No' (for number)

2007-03-06  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Added new pattern for

	parentheses), 'VOLUME', 'PAGE';

2007-03-05  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: Fixed errors when
	handling 'Error' exceptions. Previously there was an attempt to
	acces the attribute 'value' of these Error exceptions: this
	attribulte doesn't existm so removed call to it; Corrected some
	calls to function 'errorMsg': too few parameters had been supplied
	in certain cases;

2007-03-05  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: When recognising numeration
	for titles, made parentheses optional for YEAR in the case where we
	find 'VOL, SER, PAGE, YEAR';

2007-03-05  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Reference line markers are now
	stripped before the line is processed for citations. This avoids
	the rare case when the line marker is alphabetical and is
	recognised as a reference.

2007-03-05  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Modification of
	title-numeration patterns: Now only recognising reasonable 'years',
	(e.g. 1895, 1987, 2004, etc) as opposed to '2500' - anything past
	2099 will not be recognised as the year; Correction of patterns
	used for looking for numeration split by a title; Modification of
	algorithm used to search for titles in the line: Previously only
	searched for titles in a line if some numeration was found. This
	made it impossible to look for numeration that was split by a
	title, so now refextract looks for titles in all lines, regardless
	of numeration;

2007-03-02  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Corrected handling of IBIDs:
	in certain cases, the series could be tagged onto a replaced IBID
	title multiple times. Now working correctly; Added a few more test
	reference lines to 'test_get_reference_lines' function;

2007-03-01  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_webinterface.py: Quote filename
	argument when creating a redirect from old-style "getfile.py" URL
	to the new-style "files" URL.  Fixes problem with filenames
	containing spaces and whatnot.

2007-03-01  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat.py: Made language-dependant

	Added some new test reference lines to the function
	'test_get_reference_lines'; Some more cleaning - splitting very
	long lines up over several lines;

2007-02-28  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webcoll.py: Added a command-line
	option to regenerate collection cache pages in a certain language
	only.

2007-02-28  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_dblayer.py: Fixed a SQL error in

2007-02-28  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_utils.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_xml_record.py: Improved
	formatting speed in backward (PHP) compatibility mode, by using
	pregenerated MARCXML. Updated xm output to be generated on-the-fly
	only in few cases.

2007-02-28  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/file.py: Removed unused mod_python.apache
	import so that this module can be used in CLI-context applications
	such as bibupload.

2007-02-28  Samuele Kaplun <samuele.kaplun@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_templates.py,

	modules/websession/lib/webuser.py,
	modules/websession/lib/webuser_regression_tests.py: Restyling of
	the "Edit settings" form: the new separated password part now
	request the old password in order to set a new one).

2007-02-28  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Added checking for
	UnicodeErrors when reading in the preprint-report numbers and the
	periodical titles knowledge bases: if a line with badly encoded
	characters is read in, refextract will die with an error; Docstring
	line-length shortening after pylint convention complaints;

2007-02-27  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webcoll.py: Precalculate latest
	additions info independently of language and simple/advanced search
	interface context.  Also, do not calculate this information for
	aggregate-type of collections when the latest additions box is not
	displayed.  These two changes speed up the webpage cache generation
	considerably.

2007-02-27  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webcoll.py: Fixed collection's

	only part 2" situations.

2007-02-27  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webcoll.py: Added optional "part"
	argument to update only certain cache parts (1=reclist, 2=webpage).

2007-02-27  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Fixed a problem with the
	rebuilding of the reference section: The function that tries to
	rebuild the reference section based upon the reference line number
	(and thus ensures that reference lines are numbered consecutively)
	was not working correctly - fixed; Corrected bug concerning
	escaping of file names when calling pdftotext/gfile; Dropped a
	function that duplicated a call to gfile; Some docstring cleaning;

2007-02-27  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/bibharvest_templates.py,
	modules/bibharvest/lib/bibharvestadminlib.py: Improved handling of
	non-standard OAI responses from OAI sources (possibility to harvest
	these sources even if a non-standard response has made BibHavest
	believe that source is not OAI).  Added free textboxes to specify
	set and metadata prefix in web interface in case the values
	supported by the source could not be retrieved.  Some code
	cleaning.

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Report_Number_Generation.py,
	modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Upload_Files.py:
	Report_Number_Generation.py

2007-02-23  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: If parentheses were stripped

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/oai_repository.py,
	modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiarchive_engine.py: Fixed a bug that could
	prevent adding records to the OAI repository if they had been
	previously removed. Keep records if they have been removed from a
	set but still belong to another set. Do not print <setspec> if set
	is blank when serving values to harvesters.

2007-02-22  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Altered the pattern used for

	output.

2007-02-22  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: cli_opts was accidentally
	declared inside the except clause of the try/except import
	statements - moved it out; Altered pattern for recognition of
	institutional report numbers: previously, '\b' was used for the
	beginning of a matched report-number. However, there were cases
	when report-numbers were matched inside a URL. Therefore, the
	boundary for the beginning was updated to '[^a-zA-Z0-9/.]'.

2007-02-22  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Updates written by TonyO: New,
	improved behaviour of "verbose" mode; various internal changes to

	'sre' library throughout - 're' is no longer used.

2007-02-15  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract_config.py: Removed some config
	variables that were no longer needed.

2007-02-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL: Use v0.92.1 version number in the build example as per
	the forthcoming release.

2007-02-14  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Fixed a bug in the
	recognition/markup of URLs: string index was out when rebuilding
	the line with the URL marked-up.

2007-01-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Use bibformat.format_record()
	rather than search_engine.print_record() to obtain MARCXML of
	existing records that are to be updated.  This fixes the problem of
	revival of deleted records.

2007-01-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload_regression_tests.py: Enhanced the

2007-01-25  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: When using the new

2007-01-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Introduced
	different CSS style properties for "Narrow by collection", "Focus
	on", and "Search also" boxes.  This permits to differentiate them
	graphically by CSS without having to edit the templates.

2007-01-19  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/file.py: More fixes related to the new
	bibdoc.status column meaning.  (Still, the currently mixed
	string/int value policy is not cool and should be properly
	cleaned.)

2007-01-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearchadminlib.py: Escape collection
	definition when modifying a collection, fixing display problems for
	collections defined via phrase searches (quotes).

2007-01-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_migration_kit.py: bfe_to_create

	reporting the problem.

2007-01-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_migration_kit_templates.py: Fixed

	* Makefile.am: Added forgotten "bibdoc.status" column value update
	(deleted->1) that must be done when upgrading to v0.92.0.  (The
	bibdoc.status column treatment is to be fully prettified later,
	e.g. the column type still stayed char, etc.)  Thanks to Mike
	Marino for reporting the problem.

2007-01-17  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibedit_templates.py: Updated BibEdit header

	the context of a submission.)

2007-01-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearchadminlib.py: When creating new
	portalbox, do not escape HTML markup in its title or body,

	JavaScript function.

2007-01-16  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Convert_RecXML_to_RecALEPH.py:
	Completely re-wrote function. Better error-checking, etc.

2007-01-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: During "make update-v0.92.0-tables", set the note
	column of the admin account to the activated state, if not done
	yet.

2007-01-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql.wml: Create "admin" user in an
	already-activated account state (note=1), fixing admin login
	problems for sites created with the mostly-closed account policy
	(CFG_ACCESS_CONTROL_LEVEL_ACCOUNTS>0).	Thanks to Theodoros
	Theodoropoulos.

2007-01-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Added "update-v0.92.0-tables" target.

2007-01-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

2007-01-16  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Allocate_ALEPH_SYS.py: Changed
	names of 3 config variables to take the standard 'CFG_*' form; Some
	minor cleaning of code.

2007-01-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL: Added note on SELinux and Fedora Core 6 concerning the
	need to check the Apache user write permissions, thanks to Kam-ming
	Ku.

2007-01-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/doc/admin/guide.html.wml: Use blank space as
	empty indicator in the MARCXML guide example.

2007-01-15  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/lib/bibconvert.py: Fixed a bug concerning
	empty fields. Functions attached to fields are no longer ignored
	when the field has no value.

	E.g. Consider the following line:   300---<datafield tag="300"
	ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield
	code="a"><:Num::Num:><:Num::Num::IF(,mult. p,
	p):></subfield></datafield> If there is no value for the field
	"Num", the desirable output is:   <datafield tag="300" ind1=" "
	ind2=" "><subfield code="a">mult. p</subfield></datafield> However,
	this did not work - when Num had no value, the function (IF in this
	case) was ignored and the line was not printed.  This has been
	fixed. Also now, given the following template line:
	300---<datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield
	code="a"><:Num::Num:><:Num::Num::IF(,, p):></subfield></datafield>
	If the value of Num is "33", the following will be printed:
	<datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">33
	p</subfield></datafield> If however Num has no value, the line will
	not be printed. This is because the "IF" function will return
	nothing, and it is considered undesirable to print the line.

2007-01-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_external_collections_searcher.py,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearch_external_collections_utils.py:
	Print eventual warnings and errors on stderr, not stdout.  Fixes
	problem with indirect importation of these files by bibconvert via
	search engine, potentially messing up bibconvert's output.  The
	proper treatment of warnings/errors is to be introduced later
	together with the rewrite of errorlib.

2007-01-12  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/bibharvestadminlib.py: More detailed
	status returned by validate() function when validating OAI source.

2007-01-11  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibedit_engine.py,
	modules/bibedit/lib/bibedit_templates.py,
	modules/bibedit/web/admin/bibeditadmin.py: Fixed bug where some
	fields would never be edited (because of check on values to
	validate modification). Based edition on field/subfield index
	instead of values.

2007-01-11  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/doc/admin/guide.html.wml,
	modules/bibformat/doc/hacking/api.html.wml: Updated guide and API
	for document how to escape values.

2007-01-10  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibedit_engine.py,
	modules/bibedit/lib/bibedit_templates.py: Fixed bug that would
	cause modification of wrong subfield when several fields would have
	the same tag, indicators, subcode and value.  Fixed bug that would
	delete all subfields instead of only one when one field would have
	many subfields with same subcode and value.  Modified some
	comments.

2007-01-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* CREDITS: Acknowledged Guido and Theodoros with respect to the
	stopwords list contribution.

	* modules/miscutil/demo/demobibdata.xml: Prefixed abstract fields
	of demo records 75 and 76 with keyword <!--HTML-->, as these fields
	contain HTML tags. Updated <br> tags of these fields to <br /> to
	be XHTML valid.

2007-01-09  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_abstract.py: Added HTML-aware
	escaping (from htmlutils.py) for field values starting with keyword
	<!--HTML-->. Modified bfe_abstract to use this escaping.

2007-01-08  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmitadmin_templates.py: Corrected bug
	in modification of doctype details. Attempted to cgi.escape a None

	BibFormat admin interface from new admin when web interface
	language has been changed.

	modules/websubmit/etc/bibconvert/config/EDSRPICTcreate.tpl.in,
	modules/websubmit/etc/bibconvert/config/EDSRPICTmodify.tpl:
	Upgraded demo submission templates. Re-ordered lines by ascending
	MARC field number; Changed labels for creation and modification
	template lines - no longer using 'AU','TI', etc - now labelled by
	MARC field codes; Separated FIRST and ADDITIONAL authors into
	100__a for first author, 700__a for additional authors; Added space
	into empty indicators for datafields; Other general upgrades,

	number; Changed labels for creation and modification template lines
	- no longer using 'AU','TI', etc - now labelled by MARC field
	codes; Separated FIRST and ADDITIONAL authors into 100__a for first
	author, 700__a for additional authors; Added space into empty

	Modification of Authors in the TEXT and RTEXT submissions will
	cause their affiliations to be lost. This needs to be fixed for a
	future release.

2006-12-21  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/democfgdata.sql.wml: Updated definition of
	'AU' WebSubmit element: changed MARC Code value from '100__a' to
	'100__a,700__a'.

	* modules/websubmit/lib/functions/Create_Modify_Interface.py: *
	Updated 'Create_Modify_Interface_getfieldval_fromDBrec' function to
	enable the retrieval of data from multiple fields. Previously, it
	was only possible to retrieve data from 1 field (e.g. '100__a').
	Now it is possible to pass multiple fields separated by commas
	(e.g. '100__a,700__a').The field values will be joined into a
	string, separated by newlines. * Added a better doc-string. *
	Cleaned some coding style.

2006-12-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_templates.py: Use new URL schema
	in the "more information: click here" link on the publication line
	page.  (Note: this functionality is currently broken for the
	Atlantis demo site, because it points to the detailed record page
	of a record that has not been uploaded yet!)

2006-12-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/web/publiline.py: Updated link to the fulltext
	file location in the sent email.

	restricted primary collection.	(Note: may break third party code
	that tries to get MARCXML of any record via search interface
	without supplying proper access credentials.)

2006-12-21  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_authors.py: Removed 'contact
	person' (field 270 $p) from list of authors.

	right after the "make install" step.  Updated location of the
	"Atlantis Institute of Fictive Science" canonical demo site.

2006-12-20  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL: Reogranized some parts of the installation instructions,
	most notably folded up the three commands that are explicitly
	hinted at during the "make install" process.  Added handling of
	Apache group write privileges.	Other minor text updates.

2006-12-20  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/bin/dbtest.in: When the DB connection is not
	working, offer explicit SQL statement how to grant the access
	rights.

2006-12-20  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/testimport.py: Improved the detection of the
	most probable "site-packages" directory location that could have
	been false in presence of EGG packages on the system.

2006-12-20  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	po/sv.po, po/uk.po: Update message references in view of
	forthcoming v0.92.0 release.

2006-12-20  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: When some records could not
	have been uploaded due to errors such as non-existent record
	replacement, print the parsed failed records into the standard
	error stream for easier manual inspection by the admin later.
	(Note that if the input is a badly formatted XML file to boot, so
	that some of the records could not have even been properly parsed,
	the standard error stream will currently contain only a note about
	the problem, not the precise location of the problematic place in
	the input file.)

2006-12-20  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine_tests.py: Updated 2 tests
	according to new escaping policy

	* Makefile.am: Added OAI migration script (from table 'oaiSET' to
	table 'oaiARCHIVE', v 0.7.1).  Added update script for OAIArchive
	table (from v 0.90.1)

	modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiarchive_engine.py,
	modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiarchiveadminlib.py: Reverted back to the
	use of column 'setDefinition' in table 'oaiARCHIVE' instead of
	multiple columns 'p1', 'f1', 'm1', 'p2' etc. for storing set
	definition.  Small HTML/Python code cleaning.

2006-12-19  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	escaping of 'title'.

2006-12-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Fixed correct mode so that
	only the field instances matching the complete tag+ind1+ind2
	combinations found in the input file are corrected.

2006-12-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload_regression_tests.py: Enhanced
	correct mode test.

2006-12-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload_regression_tests.py: Added test
	on the indicator behaviour (empty indicators, blank space
	indicators).  Updated other tests to reflect the new blank space
	indicator policy (as dictated by MARCXML schema) and the new
	subfieldless output format for controlfields.

2006-12-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibrecord_tests.py: Updated test MARCXML and
	expected results according to the new default policy with blank
	space indicators.

2006-12-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibrecord.py: Updated wash_indicators()
	docstring and other mostly cosmetic updates related to new default
	blank-space indicator settings.

2006-12-18  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_utils.py: Updated record_get_xml
	to produce correct indicator values (whitespace for empty
	indicators instead of no space).

2006-12-18  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibrecord.py: Made BibRecord handle
	whitespaces in the same way as blank spaces and underscore for
	indicator values.

2006-12-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Print international
	collection names in the "no match found..." message that is shown
	when no direct hits were found in the current collection(s)
	selected by the user and when some hits are findable in other
	collections.  Thanks to Ferran Jorba for the initial patch
	addressing the issue.

2006-12-18  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_addresses.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_bibtex.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_cited_by.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_title.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_topbanner.py: Added 'manual'
	escaping of some format elements producing HTML.

2006-12-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Whenever a blank space
	indicator (or an old-style "empty" indicator) is encountered, store
	it as underscore into bibxxx tables.

2006-12-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: When producing ALEPH
	sequential-like textual output format (e.g. HTML MARC), do not
	print fake subfields ($$_) for controlfields (002-009) but rather
	use standard 001-like output line without any subfields.  (NOTE:
	this correction may break third-party code relying on the old HTML
	MARC output style for controlfields, wrongly used hitherto.)

2006-12-18  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/demobibdata.xml: Use blank space for empty
	indicators, as per MARCXML schema.

2006-12-18  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_keywords.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_notes.py: Escaped some values.
	Replaced built-in 'map' function with list comprehensions.

2006-12-18  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	bfe_xml_record unescaped by default.

2006-12-18  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_bibtex.py: Normalized marc in
	calls to field values.	Made the module not escaped by default.

2006-12-18  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_publi_info.py: Fixed bug when
	trying to escape 'None' values.

2006-12-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/bin/bibreformat.in,
	modules/bibformat/doc/admin/guide.html.wml,

	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_title.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_topbanner.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_url.py: Escaping enabled by
	default for output produced by all format elements.  Added
	possibility for elements to override this default behaviour through
	escape_values() function.  Modified elements that produced HTML to
	disable escaping using above function.

2006-12-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/doc/admin/Makefile.am: Modified to reflect
	name changes of example files example_oaimarc2xm_collID.kb and
	example_oaimarc2xm.xsl.

2006-12-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	modules/bibconvert/doc/admin/example_oaimarc2xm_collID.kb,
	modules/bibconvert/doc/admin/oaimarc2marcxml_sample.xsl: Renamed
	example files.	TOBEREMOVED default string in kb has been renamed
	_DELETE_.  Example kb modified to not show a one to one mapping.

2006-12-15  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmitadmin_engine.py: Corrected
	undefined variable problems; corrected import of
	'acc_deleteUserRole' from 'invenio.access_control_admin';

2006-12-15  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmitadmin_templates.py: Fixed unquoted
	SIZE attribute of INPUT tag in function
	"tmpl_display_addelementform" (udes to configure a WebSubmit form
	element);

2006-12-14  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_templates.py: Fixed a bug where
	text input fields could have a MAXLENGTH of ZERO when a value was
	not set for MAXLENGTH in the element definition in the WebSubmit
	DB; Fixed some string escaping for JavaScript repopulation of
	element values on page-refresh: previously double-quotes would
	break the JavaScript; Cleaned up a few HTML tags;

2006-12-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL, po/bg.po, po/ca.po, po/cds-invenio.pot, po/cs.po,
	po/de.po, po/el.po, po/en.po, po/es.po, po/fr.po, po/hr.po,
	po/it.po, po/ja.po, po/no.po, po/pl.po, po/pt.po, po/ru.po,

	modules/bibconvert/doc/admin/doctype.kb,
	modules/bibconvert/doc/admin/oaimarc2marcxml_sample.xsl: Added
	sample kb and xsl config file as an example of XSL transformation
	done with BibConvert, using BibConvert internal formatting
	functions.

2006-12-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* CREDITS: Added Jasna Markovic for the contributions to the
	Croatian translation.

2006-12-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/etc/oaidc2marcxml.xsl,
	modules/bibconvert/etc/oaimarc2marcxml.xsl: Added licence info at
	beginning of stylesheets.  Added comments.

2006-12-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_issn.py: Added journal-issn
	mappings collected from http://cdsweb.cern.ch/.  Removed 'limit'
	option which was not necessary (building mappings is fast).

2006-12-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_issn.py: Added check on
	CFG_CERN_SITE to select correct field for getting journal name when
	formatting.  Revised function names
	(build_distant_issns->build_issns_from_distant_site and
	build_local_issns->build_issns_from_local_site)

2006-12-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/lib/bibconvert_xslt_engine.py: Simplified
	calls to BibConvert formatting function from XSL stylesheet by
	handling node in function in addition to string values.

2006-12-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/lib/bibconvert.py: Made formatting function
	'KB' aware of default KBs directory to load kb files from there
	when full path not specified in calls to 'KB'.	Some code
	reformatting.

2006-12-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/hr.po: Added third batch of Croatian translation messages,
	thanks to Alen and Jasna.

2006-12-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload_regression_tests.py: All the
	regression tests updated to test also HTML MARC output, not only
	XML MARC.  This helps to detect errors in bibxxx table updating,
	because HTML MARC is currently constructed out of bibxxx tables,
	not from XML MARC.

2006-12-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Fixed "reference" upload mode
	to populate bibxxx tables too.	bibupload() now returns recid as
	integer, not string.

2006-12-13  Diane Berkovits <diane.berkovits@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webgroup.py: Infos message indeed not
	translated(cf previous commit).  _ removed to avoid confusion.
	Need to be investigated later.

2006-12-13  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/lib/bibconvert_xslt_engine.py: Added support
	for BibConvert 'formatting functions' to XSL processors (both
	libxslt and 4suite).

2006-12-12  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/etc/oaimarc2marcxml.xsl: Uses double quotes
	instead of single quotes for XPath tests.  Take
	http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim namespace into acccount. Sources not
	referring to this namespace will not work.

	Commented stylesheet to make clear that it is only a sample
	stylesheet.

	Added CUSTOMIZEME labels.

	Added possibility to drop only subfield of collection identifier
	instead of all 980 field.

	Changed default dropped field from 980__a to 980__w.

	Some simplification of the stylesheet.

2006-12-12  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/etc/oaidc2marcxml.xsl: Uses double quotes
	instead of single quotes for XPath tests.

2006-12-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/doc/guide.html.wml: Added Catalan and Spanish
	translation, thanks to Beatriu Piera and Ferran Jorba.	Also,
	cloned English translation into all the other languages.  (This
	cloning process is to be obsoleted when the WML dependency is
	released, to make the I18N file editing less heavy.)

2006-12-12  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	curve set to "" when 245__a is misssing

2006-12-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Do not use @MKINSTALLDIRS@ but rather

	Sarge's default.

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Changed bibupload behaviour
	so that it would not modify the "mode" option from record to
	record.  This provides a cleaner fix of the previous mode-saving
	commit (1.15).	Also, fixed time and stats updating in case of
	"replace_or_insert" mode.

2006-12-07  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Do not use table aliases in
	"DELETE x FROM ... LEFT JOIN" SQL statements, because MySQL 4.0 and
	5.0 behave differently in this regard.	(One version requires
	aliases to be in x too, the other version forbids it.)

2006-12-07  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Save option
	insert/replace/both (-r -i) before the upload of each record in
	order to restore it after, as upload function modifies this option
	to 'insert' in the case where 'insert_or_replace' mode is used and
	insertion of record has to be done.

2006-12-07  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_regression_tests.py: Fixed typo.

2006-12-07  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py.wml: Fixed problem of table
	status detection in case of mxdatetime module presence/absence for
	some MySQLdb versions.	(Returning back to the technique of
	checking for long/None rather than datetime/str types.)

2006-12-07  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/demo/democfgdata.sql.wml,

	options; no options have values except "stage", "verbose", and
	"user".  Fixed detection of "replace_or_insert" mode.  Fixed

	CFG_WEBSEARCH_GOOGLE_* variables not needed anymore.

2006-11-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* config/config.wml: Removed CFG_GOOGLE_* variables now that the
	configuration of external collection searching is part of WebSearch
	Admin.	Also, done some cosmetic changes (split long documentation
	lines).

2006-11-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Show I18N collection
	names in "Search collections:" boxes on the search results page,
	depending on the current interface language.  Thanks to Guido for
	reporting the problem and to Ferran for a first patch addressing
	the issue.  Closes #3260.

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: Added support for intelligent
	upload of records having external SYSNO or OAI ID tag present.	It
	is assumed that these ID tags are not repetitive (usually true),
	otherwise the first value is taken into account.  Added
	wipe_out_record_from_all_tables() suitable mostly for the
	regression test suite only.  Cleaned up some queries and some code,
	but more is still desired.

2006-11-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload_config.py: Use full location of
	external SYSNO tag, including indicators and subfield code,
	otherwise it could lead to problems if the field would be (mis)used
	to store some other information too.

2006-11-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* config/config.wml: Updated doc for external SYSNO tag location

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py.wml: When detecting the position
	of creation_time column in TABLE STATUS commands in MySQL 4.0, 4.1
	and 5.0, use explicit datetime.datetime or str comparisons (due to
	MySQLdb 0.9.2) instead of the 'not long' shortcut, because of
	possible NULL values.

2006-11-29  Gregory Favre <gregory.favre@cern.ch>

	* po/fr.po: Updated french translation (bibformat and search
	external collections were added).

	reference.

2006-11-20  Gregory Favre <gregory.favre@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/htmlutils.py: Introducing htmlutils. This
	pythonic module provides a class which escapes HTML text, in order
	to avoid XSS exploits.

2006-11-17  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/etc/format_templates/Picture_HTML_brief.bft:
	Removed usage of '$' in marc notation.

2006-11-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/bg.po, po/ca.po, po/cds-invenio.pot, po/cs.po, po/de.po,

	po/ja.po, po/no.po, po/pl.po, po/pt.po, po/ru.po, po/sk.po,
	po/sv.po, po/uk.po: Update message  references forthe
	0.91.0.20061116 release.

2006-11-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac: Bump up the version number for the 0.91.0.20061116
	release.

2006-11-16  Gregory Favre <gregory.favre@cern.ch>

	* modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket.py,
	modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_config.py,
	modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_dblayer.py,
	modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_templates.py,
	modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_webinterface.py: Enhanced last
	quickfix on webbasket (problem while creating new baskets). displa
	y_public now returns list of all public baskets if no bsk_id is
	given. General c ode refactoring (line length, conventions and
	documentation).

2006-11-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/doc/admin/guide.html.wml: Fixed some typos.

2006-11-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/doc/admin/guide.html.wml: Fixed wrong example
	in bibupload admin guide.

2006-11-15  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_bfx_engine.py: Fixed typos.

2006-11-14  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_field.py: Modified bfe_field
	to have one separator for subfields of an instance, and one
	separator between instances. DEPRECATES the use of 'separator'
	parameter for this element. Please check your templates.

2006-11-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/hr.po: Added first batch of Croatian translation messages,
	thanks to Alen.

2006-11-13  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_bfx_engine.py: Fixed typo.

2006-11-13  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* ABOUT-NLS, CREDITS, config/cdswmllib.wml, config/config.wml,

	message catalogue translation is still to come.

2006-11-13  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/oai_repository.py: OAI-compliant
	repository regarding deleted records.

2006-11-13  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/bin/bibharvest.in: Some code reformatted
	nicely

2006-11-13  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/doc/admin/guide.html.wml: Fixed typo.

2006-11-10  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: When searching, wash also
	the "limit to" search pattern argument.  Useful for dynamic search
	options such as "$TODAY$".

2006-11-09  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/etc/format_templates/Picture_HTML_brief.bft:
	Prints only English abstract for brief picture format.

2006-11-09  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_abstract.py: Fix to let format
	templates choose the language to print for the abstract.

2006-11-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload_regression_tests.py: Use recID 3
	instead of 10 for the replace tests.  Also, the tests now restore
	back the original record #3 MARCXML after each replace test (modulo
	output formats) so that one could continue with most of other tests
	(e.g. reindexing, search engine) as usual, without having to
	recreate the demo site.

2006-11-09  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/bin/bibreformat.in: Updated bin/bibreformat to
	also reformat records which do not have an 'xm' representation in
	the bibfmt database.  Some code cleaning.

2006-11-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py: Added
	regressions tests for search results sorting functionality.

2006-11-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: When sorting search
	results with a preferential sort pattern ("sp"), compare values
	regardless of the case.  This seems to be more plausible because
	searches themselves are case-insensitive.

2006-11-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webcoll.py: Use BibFormat's
	format_record() when creating "Latest additions" box.  This permits
	the page to look up-to-date even if the individual records have not
	been bibreformatted yet, as format_record() will format them on the
	fly.

2006-11-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibsched.py: When submitting a new
	periodical task after it has finished, update the task arguments
	(task id, runtime) properly.  Fixes a problem with the automatic
	mode.

2006-11-08  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibedit_templates.py: Raise a FIXME message
	when trying to edit records with controlfields.  (Currently BibEdit
	does not seem to do it properly.)

2006-11-08  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Fixed usage of spaces instead of tabs in the last
	commit.

2006-11-08  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearchadminlib.py: When adding a
	portalbox, do not exclude those already added, because one may want
	to reuse them for different language.  Thanks to Ferran.

2006-11-08  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_abstract.py: Improved kwalitee
	of element

2006-11-08  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmitadmin_dblayer.py: Added functions
	to correct the scores of the categories of a document type, and to
	enable a category to be moved up or down in score. Also updated
	functions that manipulate categories to be aware of scores.

2006-11-08  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmitadmin_engine.py: Added functions
	to enable a category to be moved up or down in score when
	configuring a document type.

2006-11-08  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmitadmin_templates.py: Added arrow
	buttons enabling the categories of a document type to be moved up
	or down in score on the interface; Updated the button for adding a
	new category to a document type to say 'Add Category' instead of
	'Save Category'.

2006-11-08  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: Modified the display
	of a document type's categories - now displayed in ascending order
	of score, then alphabetical order of category long name.

2006-11-08  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/web/admin/websubmitadmin.py: Added parameters
	(movecategup, movecategdown, jumpcategout, jumpcategin) necessary
	to move a category from one score to another when configuring a
	document type.

2006-11-07  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Added KEY 'doctype' to table 'sbmCATEGORIES' on
	column 'doctype'.

2006-11-07  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabcreate.sql: Updated definition of
	'sbmCATEGORIES' table to include a PRIMARY KEY on columns 'doctype'
	and 'sname', and a KEY on column 'doctype'.

2006-11-07  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Added primary key to table 'sbmCATEGORIES' based on
	the columns 'doctype' and 'sname'. A document type should never
	have duplicated categories.

2006-11-06  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/kwalitee.py: Removed kwalitee test of
	test_5.py element as it has no docstring on purpose, and would bias
	the result of kwalitee.

2006-11-06  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/kwalitee.py: Removed debug print statement
	introduced in the previous commit.

2006-11-06  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/kwalitee.py: Filter non python files when
	checking kwalitee of some files to prevent division by zero error.

2006-11-06  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webstyle_templates.py: Activated parameters
	"titleprologue" and "titleepilogue" in tmpl_page().  Removed
	unnecessary "lastupdated" treatment from the tmpl_page(), since
	"lastupdated" is treated (and printed) in tmpl_pagefooter().

2006-11-06  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/web/admin/bibformat_migration_kit_assistant.py,
	modules/bibformat/web/admin/bibformatadmin.py: Improved kwalitee of
	web admin files.

2006-11-03  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_dblayer.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine_tests.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_migration_kit.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_migration_kit_assistant_lib.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_migration_kit_dblayer.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_migration_kit_templates.py,
	modules/bibformat/lib/bibformatadminlib.py: Improved overall
	kwalitee of BibFormat.

2006-11-03  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Added ALTER TABLE rule to 'update-v0.90.1-tables' to
	add a tinyint field 'score' to sbmCATEGORIES. This will allow the
	submission categories of a document type to be ordered in the
	WebSubmit interface.

2006-11-03  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine.py: Removed parse_tag
	function from bibformat_engine, and import it from bibformat_utils.
	Minor modifications to comments.

2006-11-03  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_field.py,
	modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_indexer.py: Use of parse_tag
	function of bibformat_utils instead of bibformat_engine

2006-11-03  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_utils.py: Moved 'parse_tag'
	function from bibformat_engine to bibformat_utils

2006-11-02  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/elements/bfe_field.py: Fixed bfe_field
	element to work with control fields.

2006-11-02  Diane Berkovits <diane.berkovits@cern.ch>

	* modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket.py: Add check for parameter
	values in perform_request_add when topic and basket are not
	selected in list boxes.

2006-11-01  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL, modules/miscutil/demo/demo-site-apache-user-passwords,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py,
	modules/websession/lib/webuser_tests.py: Changed passwords of the
	demo users Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in order to have passwords
	different from usernames (jekyll/j123kyll, hyde/h123yde).  Better
	for regression testing.  Added a note on crypt() using the first 8
	characters only in the default Apache htpasswd encryption method.

2006-11-01  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py: Added tests
	for the Results overview box and links to results in various
	collections when the "split by collection" is on/off.

2006-11-01  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/bin/bibreformat.in,
	modules/bibharvest/bin/oaiarchive.in,
	modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiharvestlib.py,
	modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py,
	modules/bibrank/bin/bibrank.in, modules/bibsched/lib/bibtaskex.py,
	modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webcoll.py,
	modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: When authentifying user-supplied
	email or nickname, use two SQL queries rather than a single boolean
	OR query, for the latter one doesn't make use of indexes.  This
	speeds up the authentication for large sites considerably, e.g.
	about three orders of magnitude for the CERN site.

2006-10-31  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_engine.py: call_old_bibformat()
	now also has an on-the-fly mode.  Useful for bibreformat when the
	old formats are still being used.

2006-10-31  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat.py: Pass the on-the-fly parameter
	to the old formatter too.

2006-10-31  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/bin/bibreformat.in: Call format_record() in the
	on-the-fly mode; this is a must during bibreformatting.

2006-10-31  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/bin/bibreformat.in: Removed unnecessary use of
	pylibdir.

2006-10-31  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webstyle_templates.py: Remove empty space
	that was printed in the page header before the DOCTYPE line.

2006-10-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: On the search
	results page, when printing results split by collections, quote the
	collection name fully in the name of every section so that the
	links from the search results overview are properly resolved.
	(Unquoted names worked fine with Firefox or Konqueror but not with
	MSIE.)

2006-10-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Fixed printing of ALEPH
	sequential-like format when invalid tags were asked for.

2006-10-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Removed two extraneous
	print statements from functions related to ALEPH sequential-like
	textual format.

2006-10-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Use the old output
	formatter procedure if the "ot" parameter is set.

2006-10-30  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webalert/lib/webalert_templates.py: Fixed frequency list
	in tmpl_alert_email_body() where the 'weekly' frequency was
	missing.

2006-10-25  Gregory Favre <gregory.favre@cern.ch>

	* modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket.py: Corrected a bug, introduced
	with last modification of webbasket_dblayer's
	get_personal_topics_infos, which prevented from creating a new
	basket.

2006-10-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Fixed
	get_fieldvalues_alephseq_like() in case the argument "tags_in" is
	not a list but directly a tag, as used by CERN's CLIsearch tool.

2006-10-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dbquery.py.wml: For get_table_update_time()
	and get_table_status_info() functions, when deciding whether we
	work with MySQL 4.0 or 4.1/5.0, do not use datetime.datetime types
	directly as it does not work with MySQLdb 0.9.2 that return
	strings.  Taken into account both possibilities.

2006-10-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/elmsubmit/lib/elmsubmit_EZArchive.py,
	modules/elmsubmit/lib/elmsubmit_filename_generator.py: Do not
	depend on bz2 globally, only when bz2 files are actually processed
	at runtime.  Useful for platforms where Python is compiled without
	bz2 support and where bz2 files are not being processed by the mail
	submission.

2006-10-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webinterface_tests.py: Added
	exists_config_define to the FakeApache module, as it is needed by
	some mod_python versions.

2006-10-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_templates.py: Fixed some XSS
	vulnerabilities when editing and displaying user groups.

2006-10-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_engine.py: Fixed problem of
	Propose_Next_Action's language argument not being initialized.

2006-10-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webalert/lib/webalert.py,
	modules/webalert/lib/webalert_templates.py,
	modules/webalert/lib/webalert_webinterface.py: Fixed basket
	checking code when setting up a new alert with no storing of
	results into any basket.  At the same time, fixed the most apparent
	XSS vulnerability issues of the interface.

2006-10-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webmessage/lib/webmessage_templates.py: Fixed the most
	obvious XSS vulnerability issues in WebBasket.	Beware, in the
	message display, the "final_body" now gets fully escaped, which
	results in an impossibility to format messages in HTML.  For a
	less-severe approach, only known vulnerable tags (such as
	PLAINTEXT, SCRIPT, etc) could be removed; or, even better, only
	pre-defined whitelisted tags (such as STRONG, EM, P, BR) could be
	allowed.  Currently no HTML is interpreted at all.

2006-10-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webmessage/lib/webmessage.py: Fixed XSS vulnerability in
	the warning box about non-existent users or groups.

2006-10-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket.py,
	modules/webbasket/lib/webbasket_templates.py: Fixed the most
	visible XSS vulnerability issues in WebBasket.

2006-10-22  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_external_collections.py: Escape
	"Haven't found what you were looking for?" external collection link
	labels, fixing XSS vulnerability.

2006-10-22  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webinterface.py: Added missing
	output parameter escaping in several places, satisfying the new XSS
	regression tests.

2006-10-22  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py: Introduced
	basic cross-site scripting vulnerability tests for the search
	engine.

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/bg.po, po/ca.po, po/cs.po, po/de.po, po/el.po, po/en.po,

	po/pt.po, po/ru.po, po/sk.po, po/sv.po, po/uk.po: Version increased
	to v0.91.0.

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac: Version increased to v0.91.0 in view of the
	forthcoming internal development release.

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/bg.po, po/ca.po, po/cds-invenio.pot, po/cs.po, po/de.po,
	po/el.po, po/en.po, po/es.po, po/fr.po, po/it.po, po/ja.po,
	po/no.po, po/pl.po, po/pt.po, po/ru.po, po/sk.po, po/sv.po,
	po/uk.po: Added new phrases from WebSession.

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_regression_tests.py: Added test
	for "Lost Your Password" functionality for internal accounts.

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/sk.po: A typo fixed.

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_webinterface.py: Fixed sending
	lost passwords for internal accounts (implicit or expressely
	enabled).  Introduced an error message when attempting to send
	passwords for external authentication system.  Separated phrases
	properly after successful account registration.

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_templates.py: Added template
	for the "Lost Your Password" email that reminds users of their
	passwords.  Passed language context in "Lost Your Password" web
	form.

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webaccess/doc/admin/guide.html.wml: Separate "__init__"
	from "(" so that "_(" does not get interpreted as I18N message.

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webhelp/web/admin/howto/run.html.wml: Reduced bibsched
	task cleanup interval to 7 days.  Fixed rec_fmt cleanup example.
	Added oai_archive files and enriched oaiharvest cleanup example.
	(A better common temporary file name policy would be helpful; to be
	introduced later.)

2006-10-12  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_templates.py: Added missing
	space between "Lost Your Password?" page phrases.

2006-10-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_templates.py: When editing
	account parameters, if the email address editing is disabled, such
	as when using the external authentication, pass the email value as
	read-only anyway when users choose "Set new values".  This permits
	to edit nickname for users using external authentication.

2006-10-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: Prettified fix of the previous
	commit.

2006-10-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/webuser.py: Introduced a possibility to
	register users without having to supply a valid nickname.  This is
	useful for external authentication setups so that people can login
	without having to register internal accounts first.  Thanks to
	Devin Bougie for reporting the problem.

2006-10-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiarchive_engine.py: For temporary
	directory, use tmpdir instead of /tmp.

2006-10-11  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiarchiveadminlib.py: Fixed escaping
	problem in "Edit OAI Set" pages.

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_downloads_similarity.py: Fixed bug in
	the calculation of reading similarity lists, caused by false SQL
	argument escaping (list as string).

2006-10-10  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql.wml: Harmonized action names to
	be the same as used during the upgrade.

2006-10-10  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Enriched update-v0.7.1-tables target for proper
	CDSware v0.7.1 to CDS Invenio v0.90.0 migration.  Accounts for all
	table changes and basket migration.  Remains to be done: OAI setup
	migration, international translations.

2006-10-10  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websession/lib/websession_templates.py: Configure
	BibHarvest now points to common OAI providing and OAI harvesting
	admin interfaces.

2006-10-10  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webhelp/web/admin/index.html.wml: Link to BibHarvest
	Admin interface now points to the intro page so that admin can
	choose between going into OAI harvesting or OAI providing admin
	interfaces.  This should better be clarified.

2006-10-10  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibharvest/lib/oaiarchiveadmin_regression_tests.py: Added
	tests for OAI sets `edit' and `delete' pages.

	* po/ca.po, po/es.po: Added translations from Ferran.

2006-10-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* ABOUT-NLS: Added Appendix B on integrating translations that were
	prepared for different software releases.

2006-10-09  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/de.po: Added translations from Guido.

2006-10-05  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_templates.py: Fixed wrong label
	in output format "dependencies" page.

2006-10-05  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_templates.py: Improved layout of
	template editor: panels resize according to window size, controls
	have been resized to fit smaller screens.

	* modules/bibformat/doc/hacking/api.html.wml: Updated APIs.

2006-10-03  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/lib/bibupload.py: (1) Put 001 in front of the
	newly inserted records, fixing a particular regression test case.
	(2) Avoid treating special tags (FMT, FFT) when updating bibxxx and
	bibrec_bibxxx tables.  (3) Removed unnecessary and repetitive
	bibxxx table existence checks, speeding up BibUpload by a factor of
	about 5.

2006-10-03  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibrecord_tests.py: Added tests for the
	desired field number argument when adding control- and data-
	fields.

2006-10-03  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/bibrecord.py: Added optional
	desired_field_number argument for record_add_field().  Useful for
	BibUpload insert mode to place controlfield 001 at the top.

2006-10-03  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL: Added note on the necessity of *not* using MySQLdb
	1.2.1_p2, for it leads to a codec error when running webcoll.
	Versions like 1.2.0 (tested on FreeBSD-6.1) or 1.2.1g2 (tested on
	Debian/Sarge) are known to work fine.  (The problems with 1.2.1_p2
	are to be fixed later.)

	* modules/miscutil/bin/testsuite.in,
	modules/websearch/lib/Makefile.am,

	* modules/bibsched/lib/bibsched.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/config.py.wml: Made BibSched refresh time
	configurable.  Set to 5 seconds by default.  Note: the automatic
	handling of new tasks is far from optimal in case the task queue
	gets big.

2006-09-22  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL, config/cdspage.wml,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py,

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Fixed XML output envelope
	prologue and epilogue for NLM and RSS formats.	Search engine now
	calls format_records() for XML formats.  (The speed of the MARCXML
	output stream should be checked.)

2006-09-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Added templates for
	the XML ouptut's prologue and epilogue, for MARCXML, NLM, and RSS.
	(DC uses default sanity prologue/epilogue.)

2006-09-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/etc/format_templates/DC.bfx,
	modules/bibformat/etc/format_templates/NLM.bfx,
	modules/bibformat/etc/format_templates/RSS.bfx: Updated DC, NLM and
	RSS templates to format one record only, since the rest of the
	formatting infrastructure works this way.

2006-09-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearchadminlib.py: Detect properly the
	timestamp of the last collection cache update.

2006-09-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webstyle_templates.py: When page() and
	pagefooter() receive the last updated timestamp in the CVS $Date$
	format, convert it to the standardized dategui I18N format.

2006-09-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_webcoll.py: Put
	language-dependent last updated timestamp in the footer.  Use the

2006-09-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dateutils.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/dateutils_tests.py: Add forgotten space at the

2006-09-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dateutils.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/dateutils_tests.py: When converting CVS dates,

	* modules/miscutil/bin/testsuite.in: Added dateutils unit tests.

	datecvs conversion.

2006-09-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dateutils.py: Added function for converting
	CVS dates to datestruct.  Useful for Last updated timestamps in
	page footers.

2006-09-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/kwalitee.py: Added explicit test for the
	number of missing docstrings.  Currently there are 893 missing
	docstrings in the whole codebase, with WebSubmit and ElmSubmit
	accounting for half of them.

2006-09-20  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/lib/websubmit_config.py: Leave wildcard config
	import here, because MESS functions seem to have funny usage of
	config variables without importing anything.  This and the exec
	stuff should really get refactored one day soon.  Left a FIXME
	note.

2006-09-20  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibconvert/lib/bibconvert.py,

	modules/websubmit/web/yoursubmissions.py,
	modules/websubmit/web/admin/referees.py: Fixed config wildcard
	import everywhere.  Fixed some randomly spotted import problems,
	such as sysexiting in case of failure.	This should never be done
	in lib files in case they are imported via Apache environment or
	via some other clients.

	modules/bibsched/lib/Makefile.am, modules/bibsched/lib/bibsched.py,
	modules/bibsched/lib/bibtaskex.py: BibSched module split into
	bin/lib completed.  Most of the stuff lives in lib.  The bin stuff
	is a simple call of the lib stuff.  While doing the split, the code
	kwalitee improved a bit.

2006-09-20  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/config.py.wml: Added CFG_PREFIX.

	Python mode in addition to the file encoding.  This declaration is

	pychecker friendlier than its inverted statement.  Changed name of
	a dummy variable to `dummy' to please pychecker.

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Fixed
	tmpl_print_record_list_for_similarity_boxen() in order to look

	pre-templated version did.

2006-08-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Removed function
	print_record_list_for_similarity_boxen() that fully lived in the
	template since some time.  Treat the "hs" format (used in

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Deleted
	urlargs_replace_text_in_arg() that is not used anymore by the

2006-08-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Fixed calls to
	get_fieldvalues_alephseq_like() where tags were not passed as a
	list but rather in a single string separated by commas.  This
	solves the problem of the HTML MARC display in case of deleted
	records.

2006-08-23  Jerome Caffaro <jerome.caffaro@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibformat/lib/bibformat_utils.py,

	that was removed by the previous commit.

2006-08-09  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py: Fixed a bug relating to
	the indexation of fulltexts: When the contents of a PDF fulltext
	are to be indexed, the tool "pdftotext" is used to convert the PDF
	to plain text. The plaintext should be utf-8 so that search_engine
	(strip_accents) can replace accented letters with their
	non-accented cousins.  However, pdftotext outputs by default
	latin-1, so no accented letters could be replaced and were kept and
	used in the fulltext word index, meaning that if you seached for a
	word containing accents, within a fulltext, you would never have
	any results, unless the non-accented "version" of that word also
	existed in the document. [E.g. searching for "später" would only
	return results for documents containing "spater" because search
	engine strips the accent in the search query, meaning that the
	query can never match the accented word in the fulltext word
	index.]  The problem was fixed by calling pdftotext with its "-enc
	UTF-8" argument.

2006-08-03  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibedit/lib/refextract.py: Added 999C6a subfield
	containing information about status of extracted references; Added
	(-r,--display-raw) flags to enable the optional inclusion of raw,
	unprocessed reference lines in the subfield 999C7f;

	massive deployment of the regression test suite.  Added basic tests
	for the availabitily of web pages of all the modules, resulting in
	216 URLs checked.  The web page availability tests are testing
	mostly the behaviour of the page when passing no arguments at all.
	For admin interfaces, the behaviour is tested when logged in as a
	guest user and as an admin.  Full regression functionality tests
	for each module to be deployed later.

	pages.	Added helper function make_surl() to create HTTPS URLs.

	suite run, using stderr where the usual output goes.  This permits
	to write detailed verbose info into a separate stdout stream.  More
	separate helper function (e.g. for logging in) would be added

	modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearch_regression_tests.py,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: fixed websearch
	template code and API so that it passes the regression test suite
	again

2006-05-29  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* config/config.wml: Explain new philosophy behind
	CFG_CALL_BIBFORMAT setting.

2006-05-29  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Call BibFormat on the fly
	for all situations, except when creating HB, when the configuration
	variable CFG_CALL_BIBFORMAT on whether we should do so or not is
	consulted.  This is in accordance with the move to dynamic detailed
	record pages.  Note: when BibFormat on the fly returns XML with FMT
	tag containing the HTML output format, as suited for the upload of
	precreated formats, call_bibformat() strips the XML envelope and
	returns HTML body only using Fred's patch, making it possible to
	have a mixed precreated/on-the-fly formatting philosophy.

	modules/bibformat/web/admin/BIBREFORMAT_display.php.wml,

	as if we were another day (for debugging purpose), which led to the
	use of the "datetime" module for date computations, instead of

	files when needed.

2005-12-21  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

2005-12-15  Gregory Favre <gregory.favre@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/errorlib.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/errorlib_tests.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/miscutil_config.py: - Solved an importation
	problem.  - Added a special error when module_config exist but

	errors

2005-12-15  Gregory Favre <gregory.favre@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/lib/webpage.py,
	modules/webstyle/lib/webstyle_templates.py: Handles new errorlib
	module. Errors are internationalized.  MOdified create_error_box
	header (accepts language)

2005-12-15  Gregory Favre <gregory.favre@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/Makefile.am,
	modules/miscutil/lib/errorlib.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/errorlib_tests.py,
	modules/miscutil/lib/miscutil_config.py: Errors are now
	internationalized. Minor bug fixes, global code improvement.  To
	properly handle errors: Create a file named following this pattern:
	modulename_config.py (e.g. webcomment_config.py)

	In this file developers should declare the following dictionnaries:
	- cfg_modulename_error_messages - cfg_modulename_warning_messages

	Content of these dictionaries: ERR_MODULENAME_ERROR_NAME:
	'_("internationalized text with eventual text replacement strings
	%s %i")'

	Errorlib will actually interpret strings for internationalization
	if they begin with '_(' and end with ')'.

	NOTE: ERR_MODULENAME must be uppercase; names of dictionary and
	config file must respect the rules defined above.

	Example:

	file miscutil_config.py: cfg_miscutil_error_messages = \ {
	'ERR_MISCUTIL_BAD_FILE_ARGUMENT_PASSED':  '_("Invalid argument %s
	was passed")',	   'ERR_MISCUTIL_WRITE_FAILED': '_("Unable to write
	to file %s")',	   'ERR_MISCUTIL_NO_ERROR_MESSAGE': '_("Trying to
	write a non error message to error log")' }

	cfg_miscutil_warning_messages = \ {   'WRN_MISCUTIL_SOME_WARNING':
	'_("example warning (%s)")',	 'ERR_MISCUTIL_STRANGE_WARNING':
	'_("Warnings can also be displayed as errors")' }

2005-12-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql.wml: First commit of the BibTeX
	format support, thanks to Oyvind.  The changes notably are:

	 - Added HX (=HTML BibTeX) behaviour, to be called on the fly.

	 - Added HX format to the format table, and renamed some existing
	   formats (e.g. MARCXML instead of XML MARC).	Note to self: the
	   formatname table is to be prefilled if we want to have full I18N
	   format names.

	 - Added _FULL_BIBTEX format to the flxFORMATS table, in a
	monolithic
	   form.  The `non-standard' fields such as URL, abstract, eprint
	   number, etc are to be studied and the treatment refined
	   (e.g. journal page numbers versus report numbers).  Also, the
	   monolithic form of this format is not admin-friendly, to be
	   refactored or possibly pybliographerized.

	 - Added KB demo values for the mapping of tag 980 values to the
	   BibTeX entry types.

	 - Added four supporting UDFs (STR_BUFFER, GET_NAME, SPLIT_LINE,
	   GET_MONTH, GET_YEAR).  May come handy independently of BibTeX.

2005-12-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabcreate.sql,
	modules/miscutil/sql/tabdrop.sql: Added flxKBDBCOLLID2BIBTEX table
	for the BibTeX support.

2005-12-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py: Added BibTeX format
	support.

2005-12-14  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearch_templates.py: Added BibTeX format
	link to the Detailed record page.  Also, do not print ``People who
	viewed this page...'' and similar boxen unless for HTML Detailed
	format.

2005-12-06  Nicholas Robinson <nicholas.robinson@cern.ch>

	* modules/websubmit/web/yoursubmissions.py: Corrected an error that
	was encountered when trying to display the name of a document type
	that no longer exists in the system.  (This situation can occur
	when listing the details of submissions made for a given doctype
	which has since been deleted from the system.  In this case the
	system can no longer find the full name for the doctype.)  Now,
	instead of an error, the document type's long name is shown as
	'***Unknown Document Type - ([doctype short name])'.

2005-12-06  Gregory Favre <gregory.favre@cern.ch>

	* modules/webstyle/css/cds.css: Corrected minor which prevented
	validation.  Suppressed several unused lines e.g. when setting
	border-collapse: collapse, the browser won't do anything with
	border-spacing...  e.g. Set margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px; instead of:
	margin-top: 1px;		margin-right: 2px;
	margin-bottom: 3px;	margin-left: 4px;

2005-12-05  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibindex/lib/bibindex_engine.py: Quick fix in order to be
	able to fulltext-index Indico URLs that do not contain explicit
	file extensions.  When indexing fulltext files (8564), an attention
	is payed to the link name $$y so that if it contains filename with
	a known extension such as example.pdf, it is assumed that the $$u
	leads to the PDF file, so that no further direct/indirect URL
	analysis is performed as would be the case for SetLink style URLs.

2005-12-05  Gregory Favre <gregory.favre@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/lib/dateutils.py: Corrected return values when
	giving default values (return N/A on GUI)

2005-12-05  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* ABOUT-NLS: Added appendix on introducing a new language,
	describing how to send us translations for dynamic elements that
	are currently not located in the PO file.  (One day they should.)

2005-12-04  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* ABOUT-NLS: Written CDSware-specific NLS information for
	administrators, translators, and programmers.

2005-12-04  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* TODO: Added BibFormat-20051010, Miscellaneous-20051114,
	WebSearch-20051017, WebSearch-20051102.

2005-12-04  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Added creation of var/run directory for bibsched pid
	file.  Added some ALTER TABLE statements for updating v0.7.1
	tables.

2005-12-04  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/web/admin/websearchadmin.py: Fixed import of
	gettext_set_language.

2005-11-27  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/i18n_extract_from_wml.py: Use more descriptive variable names
	and the help text.

2005-11-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/.cvsignore: Added .pyc to the list of CVS ignored files.

2005-11-26  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/.cvsignore, po/Makefile.in.in, po/ca.po, po/cdsware.pot,

	relative paths for WML files as well.

2005-11-25  Frederic Gobry <frederic.gobry@epfl.ch>

	* ABOUT-NLS, Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, config.rpath, configure.ac,
	po/ChangeLog, po/Makefile.in.in, po/Makevars, po/Rules-quot,
	po/boldquot.sed, po/en@boldquot.header, po/en@quot.header,
	po/insert-header.sin, po/quot.sed: Cleanup of the gettext support
	framework. C-specific checks were discarded, extra po manipulation
	rules were removed. The ABOUT-NLS file needs to stay as it is
	checked by automake directly. The content however has been changed
	to reflect the situation of CDSware.

	The m4 directory has been compacted and put into acinclude.m4. It
	could be merged into the main configure.ac file, but at a loss of
	readability IMHO.

2005-11-25  Frederic Gobry <frederic.gobry@epfl.ch>

	* po/cdsware.pot: added cdsware.pot in CVS as it avoids rebuilding
	the po files for nothing

2005-11-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/POTFILES.in: Removed some .py files that are generated from
	.wml.

2005-11-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* po/quot.sed: Added file that is required for make dist.

	po/pt.po, po/remove-potcdate.sin, po/ru.po, po/sk.po, po/sv.po,
	po/uk.po: make use of the standard gettext infrastructure, with the
	translations in a po/ directory, and the list of available
	languages in po/LINGUAS.

	There is also no message.wml extractor, as all the used messages
	have already been moved to the corresponding .po files.

2005-11-24  Diane Berkovits <diane.berkovits@epfl.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_grapher.py: Code washed using pylint.

CDSware v0.7.1 (released 2005-05-04)
====================================

	* config.nice.in: Added --with-clisp, --with-cmucl and --with-sbcl

	returns empty list for the `id' output format, regardless of the
	`req' settings.  This is useful for the search engine clients such

	to terminate a zero-hit search branch.

2005-03-31  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/bin/webcoll.wml: Introduced collection cache
	last updated timestamp, in order to relax when no record was

	the API to reading similarity functions.  Also, the records
	returned are now sorted by and presented with a score deduced not
	from the number of downloads/pageviews but from the number of
	different client hosts (readers).  This reflects better the purpose
	of the box ("people who have viewed this page have also viewed")
	and makes it somewhat harder to artificially push up one's papers
	(when done in a naive way).

2005-03-24  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_searcher_tests.py.wml:

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_citation_grapher.py.wml: Started
	refactoring.  More needed.

2005-03-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrank_grapher.py.wml: Do not use Gnuplot
	debug flag.  Moved set term to the first command position.

2005-03-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine_config.py.wml: Put

2004-08-24  Trond Aksel Myklebust <trond.aksel.myklebust@cern.ch>

	modules/bibrank/etc/jif2.kb.wml,
	modules/bibrank/etc/jt_conv.kb.wml: Removed some files from the
	next release, going to be added again later in another form

2004-08-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py.wml: Strip accents only
	when searching for words.

2004-08-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* configure-tests.py: Added test on maximum MySQLdb version.

2004-08-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	versions.

2004-08-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabcreate.sql: Revert previous
	TEXT-into-BLOB changes, since they didn't work with MySQL 4.1.3
	anyway, only with MySQL 4.1.0.	(FWIW, this shows once more that
	conceptually wrong quick-fixes are better to be avoided!)

2004-08-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* INSTALL: Added note on MySQL's default-character-set=utf8.

2004-08-23  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/miscutil/sql/tabcreate.sql: Changed BLOB to TEXT for the
	sake of MySQLdb 1.0.0 compliancy.  Changed flxLINKTYPEPARAMS/pname
	varchar width, so that the primary key size for this table will
	fall within the internal MySQL limit of 1000 bytes per key, when
	the default charset is UTF-8 (i.e. when there are three bytes per
	char).

2004-08-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/search_engine.py.wml: Put explicit str()
	conversion around datetime.datetime objects coming from MySQLdb,
	since some Python installations (e.g. reported on SUSE) required
	explicit conversion before comparing to strings.

2004-08-16  Trond Aksel Myklebust <trond.aksel.myklebust@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibrank/lib/bibrankadminlib.py.wml,

	options without selecting a fieldvalue at the same time.

2004-08-13  Trond Aksel Myklebust <trond.aksel.myklebust@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/web/admin/websearchadmin.py.wml: Fixed

	column into longtext

2004-07-27  Thomas Baron <thomas.baron@cern.ch>

	* modules/bibupload/bin/bibupload.wml: bad xml records are counted
	as errors

2004-07-22  Trond Aksel Myklebust <trond.aksel.myklebust@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/Makefile.am: Committed too much, Makefile
	fixed

2004-07-22  Trond Aksel Myklebust <trond.aksel.myklebust@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/Makefile.am,
	modules/websearch/lib/websearchadminlib.py.wml: fixed lazy
	coding...see last update of file.....

2004-07-20  Trond Aksel Myklebust <trond.aksel.myklebust@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearchadminlib.py.wml: Fixed the date
	problem. Somehow the mysql server returns  2004-07-19 14:52:48.00
	as the date, and for others it returns 2004-07-19 14:52:48

	Unsure why, but fixed now I hope.

2004-07-19  Trond Aksel Myklebust <trond.aksel.myklebust@cern.ch>

	* modules/websearch/lib/websearchadminlib.py.wml: Fixed two bugs,
	one where the mysql server returned another dateformat than the
	expected one, only partially fixed atm though. Need to find out how
	to get the dateformat which mysql will return. The other was where
	the Progress field of a bibtask was empty.

2004-07-16  Tibor Simko <tibor.simko@cern.ch>

	* modules/webhelp/web/admin/index.html.wml: Add link to BibIndex
	Admin Interface.
