[refextract]
# This is an example Reference extraction job description file.
# It holds the parameters needed for a Refextract job, which are named in the
# same way as full-length cli flags (excluding --recid).
# Other named job files can be created, thus 'saving' Refextract tasks.

# Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
# Multiple collection names can be specified using commas.
# Flags without arguments can be specified alone, or with a value of 1.

# To start a Refextract task with the parameters of a extraction-job file, use the
# --extraction-job flag, together with the name (no file extension) of this job
# file.

# Tasks ran in this way will update the Invenio installation with the new
# references via BibUpload, (adhering to modification dates of fulltext files)
