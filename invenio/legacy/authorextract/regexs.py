        Returns a regular expression to be used to identify groups of author names in a citation.
        This method contains patterns for default authors, so no arguments are needed for the
        most reliable form of matching.

        The returned author pattern is capable of:
        1. Identifying single authors, with at least one initial, of the form:
        'Initial. [surname prefix...] Surname'

        2. Identifying multiple authors, each with at least one initial, of the form:
        'Initial. [surname prefix...] Surname, [and] [Initial. [surname prefix...] Surname ... ]'
        ***(Note that a full stop, hyphen or apostrophe after each initial is
        absolutely vital in identifying authors for both of these above methods.
        Initials must also be uppercase.)***

        3. Capture 'et al' statements at the end of author groups (allows for authors with et al
        to be processed differently from 'standard' authors)

        4. Identifying a single author surname name positioned before the phrase 'et al',
        with no initials: 'Surname et al'

        5. Identifying two author surname name positioned before the phrase 'et al',
        with no initials, but separated by 'and' or '&': 'Surname [and|&] Surname et al'

        6. Identifying authors of the form:
        'Surname Initials, Initials Surname [Initials Surname]...'. Some authors choose
        to represent the most important cited author (in a list of authors) by listing first
        their surname, and then their initials. Since this form has little distinguishing
        characteristics which could be used to create a reliable a pattern, at least one
        standard author must be present after it in order to improve the accuracy.

        7. Capture editor notation, of which can take many forms e.g.
        'eds. editors. edited by. etc.'. Authors captured in this way can be treated as
        'editor groups', and hence processed differently if needed from standard authors

        @param author: (string) An optional argument, which replaces the default author

        @return: (string) The full author group identification regex, which will:
        - detect groups of authors in a range of formats, e.g.:
            C. Hayward, V van Edwards, M. J. Woodbridge, and L. Kelloggs et al.,
        - detect whether the author group has been marked up as editors of the doc.
            (therefore they will NOT be marked up as authors) e.g.:
            ed. C Hayward | (ed) V van Edwards  | ed by, M. J. Woodbridge and V van Edwards
            | L. Kelloggs (editors) | M. Jackson (eds.) | ...
        -detect a maximum of two surnames only if the surname(s) is followed by 'et al'
