<a name="1"></a><h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The remote debugger is a module that makes it easy to plug in
different debugging facilities. Debugging is automatically activated
using url param <i>debug</i> and can be switched on/off on demand.
The module itself is not a debugger, but facilitates calling of
diverse debuggers (pdb, gpdb, pydev). This module is <b>meant for
Invenio developers and other people who want to edit the Python code, please
do not use this module in production environment!</b>.</p>


<p>Debug mode is enabled by passing debug=X in the url parameter, example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
http://invenio-ubu/record/94/keywords?ln=en&debug=3
</pre>
</blockquote>

This will run the web application in an interactive mode, debugger in this case is Eclipse/Pydev.
</p>

<p>From the module documentation:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Each debugger has its own number:
local winpdb: debug=1
remote winpdb: debug=2
remote pydev: debug=3

If debug parameter is empty, the code runs normally. You can also
roll out your own debugging functions, assign it new number - look into
get_debugger()

If you want to change behaviour of the debugger interactively, you can
pass arguments encoded in the url, example:
http://someurl/collection/X?debug=3|ip:192.168.31.1|port:9999|stderr:0
look at the method signature of each debugger function to see available
arguments.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="2"></a><h2>2. Configuration</h2>

If you want to use the remote debugger for Invenio, then make sure
your local <code>remote_debugger_config.py</code> file contains:

<blockquote>
<pre>
CFG_REMOTE_DEBUGGER_ENABLED = 1
</pre>
</blockquote>

And if also want to edit modules while Apache is running and see the results immediately,
this will force Apache to reload the changed python modules located inside 'lib/python/invenio'
but it will not reload anything if you edit var/www/*.py modules.

<blockquote>
<pre>
CFG_REMOTE_DEBUGGER_WSGI_RELOAD = ['lib/python/invenio/*.py']
</pre>
</blockquote>

For a more detailed configuration and instructions how to activate individual debuggers, please
see the comments inside the
remote_debugger.py module -- as this module is for developers, I assume you will find it
very easy to understand the rest.

<strong>Note:</strong> if you are using <em>winpdb</em>, then you may
want to set the number of WSGI processes to 1 in your
<code>/opt/invenio/etc/apache/invenio-apache-vhost.conf</code>.
