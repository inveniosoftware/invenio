<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This HOWTO guide intends to explain how to use the MARC 21
format for bibliographic records in Invenio.</p>

<p><i>For an explanation of how to use MARC in authority records, 
please read <a href="howto-authority#howto-marc" target="_blank">How to MARC 
authority records</a></i>
</p>

<h2>Why to MARC at all?</h2>

<p>All the bibliographic data in the Invenio system are
internally represented in the <a
href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/">MARC 21</a> format.
There are several good reasons for this:

<ul>

<li>MARC format is <em>the</em> standard in the library world.  It is
well established and has been used since 1960s.

<li>MARC is flexible enough to represent any metadata structure you
may need now or in the future.  Therefore, Invenio can adapt to your
needs without altering its internal data structure.

<li>MARC technology, albeit developed in the punch card times
(1960s!), can be well combined with recent technologies like XML.  In
fact, whenever bibliographic metadata are to be worked with externally
in a file format, Invenio uses recently standardized <a
href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/">MARC XML</a> format
provided by the Library of Congress.

</ul>

<h2>Choosing MARC representation of your metadata</h2>

<p>Basically, you are in one of the following three situations:

<ol>

<li><p>You do not care much about internal MARC metadata structure as
far as you can work with "more meaningful" metadata concepts like
<em>author</em>, <em>abstract</em>, <em>title</em>, etc.  In this case
we simply recommend you to stick to Invenio defaults that preset for
you the most commonly used metadata fields (in alphabetical order;
non-exhaustive list):

<blockquote>
<pre>
METADATA CONCEPT             PROPOSED MARC 21 REPRESENTATION
------------------------     -------------------------------
Abstract                     520 $a
Author, first                100 $a
Author(s), additional        700 $a
Collection identifier        980 $a
Email                        8560 $f
Imprint                      260 $a,b,c; 300 $a
Keywords                     6531 $a
Language                     041 $a
OAI identifier               909CO $o
Publication info             909C4 $* [many subfields]
References                   999C5 $* [many subfields]
Primary report number        037 $a [unique throughout the system!]
Additional report number(s)  088 $a
Series                       490 $a,v
Subject                      65017 $a
Title                        245 $a
URL (e.g. to fulltext)       8564 $u, $z

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The advantage of using these Invenio defaults is that you can use
pre-defined configurations of <a href="bibconvert-admin">BibConvert</a>,
<a href="bibformat-admin">BibFormat</a>, and <a
href="bibindex-admin">BibIndex</a>.

<li><p>You do not care much about internal MARC metadata structure, so
you are using Invenio defaults, but you need to introduce a new
metadata concept.  For example, you would like to store also the
document shelf number, and you want to make it separately searchable.
In this case you are free to choose any MARC tag of your own, for
example <code>963 $6</code>.  After that you would configure Invenio
as follows:

<ul>

<li>configure <a href="bibindex-admin">BibIndex</a> to create a new
    logical field called <em>document shelf</em> and associate it with
    <code>963 $6</code> physical MARC tag;

<li>run <a href="bibindex-admin">BibIndex</a> to create word tables for
    the new searchable index;

<li>configure <a href="websubmit-admin">WebSubmit</a> to let the
    submission interface know of the existence of the new field;

<li>configure <a href="websearch-admin">WebSearch</a> to introduce the
    new searchable field into collections of your choice;

<li>configure <a href="bibformat-admin">BibFormat</a> to include
    document shelf information in the record display on search results
    pages.

</ul>

<p>which should give you the functionality you need.

<li><p>You have some constraints on the MARC level, for example you
would like to use MARC markup scheme of your own.  You are free to
define your own scheme and even invert the meaning of our default
configurations.  For each field you would simply follow the
above-mentioned configuration procedure.

<p>However, when designing your own MARC scheme, you need to think of
 two Invenio-related restrictions:

<ul>

<li>There should be no clash in the meaning of the same MARC tag in
two different collections.  For example, the tag <code>100</code>
should not mean <em>first author</em> in the Preprints collection and
<em>title</em> in the Videotapes collection.  The MARC tags are
considered to be chosen globally, in a collection-independent way.
This means that we cannot have several collections reusing the same
MARC code for their own different purposes.  (This should never happen
in well designed database system anyway, but if you have a merge of
various databases coming from various groups of users, and if you do
not have the liberty to remap their MARC tags, this may be a problem.)

<li>Also, our database design assumes that the order of repetitive
subfields inside the same field instance does not matter.  For
example, let us consider the tag <code>100</code> with the value
<code>$a Foo $a Bar $a Baz</code>.  Then, the question "what is the
second <code>$a</code> of the tag <code>100</code>?" is invalid within
the Invenio MARC paradigm.  Invenio would store a tag like that,
but not the order of repetitive subfields themselves.  In our MARC
paradigm, we prefer to code that information either (i) into different
subfields within the same field instance (<code>100 $a Foo $b Bar $c
Baz</code>), or (ii) into the same subfield but inside several field
instances (<code>100 $a Foo</code>; <code>100 $a Bar</code>; <code>100
$a Baz</code>), according to what is more appropriate.  (We think that
to rely on the order of repetitive subfields inside the same field
instance is a suspicious database design.)

</ul>

<p>These two restrictions were introduced in order to keep Invenio
bibliographic tables both simple and fast.  As explained above, we
believe that any good database design will avoid these techniques
anyway.

</ol>

<h2>MARC representation in use at CERN</h2>

<p>MARC schema that is used in the CERN library differs in some ways
from the schema found in the Invenio default configuration and in the
demo records, described under point 1 of the preceding section.  This
has got both an advantage and a disadvantage: (i) an advantage that it
permits us to easily test the behaviour of Invenio in the context of
different metadata schemata used by different Invenio installations in
the world, and (ii) a disadvantage that the default schema may be
prone to different extensions by different Invenio installations in
the world, while these extensions could have possibly been avoided by
building local extensions on top of a richer default.  (There will
probably always be local tag schema differences due to various local
cataloguing traditions.)

<p>As an example of an extensive MARC schema that could provide a
possible richer default for the Invenio installations in the world, we
are listing below all MARC tags that are in production in the CERN
Library.  Please note that in some cases the metadata choice was
dictated by local policy of a Swiss library network that the CERN
Library is participating at, and that it may deliberately differ from
the Library of Congress recommendations in some places to some extent.
(See especially tags 024, 035, 037, 518, 700, 710, 711, 720, 721, 722,
723, 724, 725, 773, 866.)

<p>If this schema is found interesting, we may also provide CERN
BibFormat etc configurations that implement it for Invenio.

                   GUIDE TO MARC21 TAGS FOR CERN AND CDSWARE

an attempt to present the actual setup of different MARC tags in use in AL500
                             at CERN

                           Maja Gracco
                           1 September 2004
                  Updated by Jocelyne Jerdelet December 2009

NOTE:
1. The abbreviations "NR" and "R" are MARC21 standards and stands for
"Not repetitive" and "Repetitive". At CERN the rule is to make a tag repetitive,
 when possible [only tags 1xx are not-repetitive] but to make subfields
non-repetitive [there are a couple of exceptions].
2. Subfield codes in AL300 are marked with $$ and subfield codes in AL500
are marked with $.
3. When different indicators are used, the tag will be repeated for each of
them like tag 246
4. [CERN] indicates, that some modifications have been done to the tag to
suit the CERN Library needs, like adding one or more subfield code(s) like
tag "773" or slightly change the content of the field like tag "037"
5. [Invenio/MySQL] indicates, that this tag is exlusively used for Invenio;
this technic is mainly used, when AL500 proposes an alpha-tag like "BAS"
6. To be able to find previous fields/tags mentioned under the title:
