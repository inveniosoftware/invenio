   ## Description:   function Send_APP_Mail
   ##                This function send an email informing the original
   ##             submitter of a document that the referee has approved/
   ##             rejected the document. The email is also sent to the
   ##             referee for checking.
   ## Author:         T.Baron
   ## PARAMETERS:
   ##                newrnin: name of the file containing the 2nd reference
   ##             addressesAPP: email addresses to which the email will
   ##                    be sent (additionally to the author)
   ##             categformatAPP: variable needed to derive the addresses
   ##                    mentioned above

    This function send an email informing the original submitter of a
    document that the referee has approved/ rejected the document. The
    email is also sent to the referee for checking.

    Parameters:

       * addressesAPP: email addresses of the people who will receive
         this email (comma separated list). this parameter may contain
         the <CATEG> string. In which case the variable computed from
         the [categformatAFP] parameter replaces this string.
         eg.: "<CATEG>-email@cern.ch"

       * categformatAPP contains a regular expression used to compute
         the category of the document given the reference of the
         document.
         eg.: if [categformatAFP]="TEST-<CATEG>-.*" and the reference
         of the document is "TEST-CATEGORY1-2001-001", then the computed
         category equals "CATEGORY1"

       * newrnin: Name of the file containing the 2nd reference of the
                  approved document (if any).

       * edsrn: Name of the file containing the reference of the
                approved document.
