    This function sends an email to the referee of a document informing
    him/her that a request for its approval has been submitted by the
    user.

    @param categ_file_appreq: (string) - some document types are
          separated into different categories, each of which has its own
          referee(s).
          In such document types, it's necessary to know the document-
          type's category in order to choose the referee.
          This parameter provides a means by which the category information
          can be extracted from a file in the current submission's working
          directory. It should therefore be a filename.

    @param categ_rnseek_appreq: (string) - some document types are
          separated into different categories, each of which has its own
          referee(s).
          In such document types, it's necessary to know the document-
          type's category in order to choose the referee.
          This parameter provides a means by which the category information
          can be extracted from the document's reference number.
          It is infact a string that will be compiled into a regexp and
          an attempt will be made to match it agains the document's reference
          number starting from the left-most position.
          The only pre-requisite is that the segment in which the category is
          sought should be indicated with <CATEGORY>.
          Thus, an example might be as follows:
             ATL(-COM)?-<CATEGORY>-.+

          This would allow "PHYS" in the following reference number to be
          recognised as the category:
             ATL-COM-PHYS-2008-001

    @param edsrn: (string) - the name of the field in which the report
          number should be placed when the referee visits the form for making
          a decision.

    @return: (string) - empty string.
