    This function sends a mail giving notification about the submission
    of a new item to the relevant recipients, including:
       + The record's Submitter(s);
       + The site ADMIN;
       + The record-type's "managers" (signified by the "submit_managers"
           parameter);

    The mail contains details of the new item's reference number(s), its
    title and its author(s). It also contains a link to the item in the
    Invenio repository.

    @param parameters: (dictionary) - contains the following parameter
         strings used by this function:

          + item_status: (string) - the status of the new item. It can be
            either "ADDED" (in which case the new item has been integrated
            into the repository), or "APPROVAL" (in which case the item is
            awaiting a referee's approval before being integrated into the
            repository, and the mail should state this fact);

          + mail_submitters: (string) - a flag containing "Y" or "N" (defaulting
            to "Y"). Determines whether or not the notification mail will be
            sent to the submitters;

          + item_managers:    (string) - a comma-separated list of email
            addresses, each of which corresponds to a "manager" for the class
            of item that has been submitted. These managers will receive the
            notification message sent by this function;

          + author_file: (string) - the name of a file that contains the names
            of the item's authors (one author per line);

          + title_file:  (string) - the name of a file that contains the title
            of the new item;

          + owners_file: (string) - the name of a file that contains the email
            addresses of the "owners" of the submitted item. I.e. those who
            will be classed as "submitters" of the item and will therefore
            have modification rights over it. The mail will be sent to these
            people. There should be one email-address per line in this file;

          + rn_file1: (string) - the name of the the file containing the item's
            principal reference number;

          + rn_file2: (string) - the name of the file containing the item's
            additional reference number(s) (e.g. sometimes two reference numbers
            are allocated during the submission process;

       @param curdir: (string) - the current submission's working directory. All
        files containing data related to the submission are stored here and
        therefore all of the files referred to in the "parameters" dictionary
        are considered to be within "curdir";

       @param form: (string) - a dictionary-like structure containing the fields
        that were present in the WebSubmit submission form;
