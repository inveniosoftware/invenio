"""WebSubmit function - Archives files uploaded with the upload file
                        interface.

To be used on par with Create_Upload_Files_Interface.py function:
 - Create_Upload_Files_Interface records the actions performed by user.
 - Move_Uploaded_Files_to_Storage executes the recorded actions.

NOTE:
=====

 - Due to the way WebSubmit works, this function can only work when
   positionned at step 2 in WebSubmit admin, and
   Create_Upload_Files_Interface is at step 1
