       Function to create an ALEPH 500 MARC DELETE record from a MARC XML
       record.

       This function depends upon the following:

         * "recmysql" is a file that already exists in the working
            submission directory. I.e. "Make_Record" has already been called and
            the MARC XML record created.

         * "recmysql" must contain an ALEPH 500 SYS in the field "970__a". That
            is to say, the function "Allocate_ALEPH_SYS" should have been called
            and an ALEPH 500 SYS allocated to this record.
            *** NOTE: "xmlmarc2textmarc" is left to check for this in the record
                      It is run in --aleph-marc=d mode, which creates an ALEPH
                      "delete" record.

       Given the valid "recmysql" in the working submission directory, this
       function will use the "xmlmarc2textmarc" tool to convert that record into
       the ALEPH MARC record. The record will then be written into the file
       "recaleph500" in the current working submission directory.

       @parameters: None
       @return: (string) - Empty string.
