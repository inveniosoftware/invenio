"""WebSubmit function - Displays a generic interface to upload, delete
                        and revise files.

To be used on par with Move_Uploaded_Files_to_Storage function:
 - Create_Upload_Files_Interface records the actions performed by user.
 - Move_Uploaded_Files_to_Storage execute the recorded actions.


NOTE:
=====
 - Due to the way WebSubmit works, this function can only work when
   positionned at step 1 in WebSubmit admin, and
   Move_Uploaded_Files_to_Storage is at step 2

FIXME:
======

 - One issue: if we allow deletion or renaming, we might lose track of
   a bibdoc: someone adds X, renames X->Y, and adds again another file
   with name X: when executing actions, we will add the second X, and
   rename it to Y
   -> need to go back in previous action when renaming... or check
   that name has never been used..

                  when adding new files.
                   - When no value is provided, users cannot add new
                     file (they can only revise/delete/add format)
                   - When a single value is given, it is used as

                      files. Restrictions can then be configured at
                      the level of WebAccess.
                      - When no value is provided, no restriction is
                        applied
                      - When a single value is given, it is used as

                      - The first value of the list is used as default
                        restriction if the user if not given the
                        choice of the restriction. CHOOSE THE ORDER!

                           allowed to delete.
                           Eg:

                           ('|' separated values)

                              about losing old formats are displayed.
                              Eg:
                                Main|Additional
                              ('|' separated values)

                             revising a file. If no value is given:
                             - no restriction is applied if none is defined
                               in the 'restrictions' parameter.
                             - else the *first* value of the 'restrictions'
                               parameter is used as default restriction.
                             Eg:
                               Main|Additional
                             ('|' separated values)
                             Use '*' for all doctypes

      + canRenameDoctypes: the list of doctypes that users are allowed
                           to rename (when revising)
                           Eg:
                             Main|Additional
                           ('|' separated values)
                           Use '*' for all doctypes

      + canNameNewFiles: if user can choose the name of the files they
                         upload (1) or not (0)

      + defaultFilenameDoctypes: Rename uploaded files to admin-chosen
                                 values. List here the the files in
                                 current submission directory that
                                 contain the names to use for each doctype.
                                 Eg:
                                 Main=RN|Additional=additional_filename
                                 ('=' separates doctype and file in curdir
                                 '|' separates each doctype/file group).

                                 If the same doctype is submitted
                                 several times, a"-%i" suffix is added
                                 to the name defined in the file.

                                 The default filenames are overriden
                                 by user-chosen names if you allow
                                 'canNameNewFiles' or
                                 'canRenameDoctypes'.

      + maxFilesDoctypes: the maximum number of files that users can
                          upload for each doctype.
                          Eg:
                            Main=1|Additional=2
                          ('|' separated values)

                          Do not specify the doctype here to have an
                          unlimited number of files for a given
                          doctype.

      + createRelatedFormats: if uploaded files get converted to
                              whatever format we can (1) or not (0)


      + deferRelatedFormatsCreation: if creation of related format is
                                     scheduled to be run later,
                                     offline (1, default) or
                                     immediately/online just after the
                                     user has uploaded the file
                                     (0). Setting immediate conversion
                                     enables workflows to process the
                                     created files in following
                                     functions, but "blocks" the user.

      + keepDefault: the default behaviour for keeping or not previous
                     version of files when users cannot choose (no
                     value in canKeepDoctypes): keep (1) or not (0)
                     Note that this parameter is ignored when revising
                     the attributes of a file (comment, description)
                     without uploading a new file. See also parameter
                     Move_Uploaded_Files_to_Storage.forceFileRevision

      + showLinks: if we display links to files (1) when possible or
                   not (0)

      + fileLabel: the label for the file field

      + filenameLabel: the label for the file name field

      + endDoc: the name of a file in curdir that contains some
