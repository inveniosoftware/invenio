   ##                we are not in the last step of an action, the action stops
   ##                anyway.

    This function stops the data treatment process even if further
    steps exist. This is used for example in the approval action. In
    the first step, the program determines whether the user approved
    or rejected the document (see CaseEDS function description). Then
    depending on the result, it executes step 2 or step 3. If it
    executes step 2, then it should continue with step 3 if nothing
    stopped it. The Finish_Submission function plays this role.
