       Get the next available ALEPH SYS from the counter file, and allocate it as the
       SYS for this record. Increment the counterby one.
       ALEPH SYS allocation works in "slots" of free numbers. For example,
       000425201 -> 000634452 for a given database may be available.
       This means that it is necessary to care about not over-stepping the maximum
       boundary. To this end, two counters (for each ALEPH Database) must be present:
          - last_SYS_<DATABASE>      (this contains the last SYS allocated for
            a database)
          - maximum_SYS_<DATABASE>   (this contains the MAXIMUM SYS allowed for a
            database)
       So, for example, for the CER database, there would be:
          - last_SYS_CER
          - maximum_SYS_CER
       When the maximum SYS has been reached, all further attempts to obtain ALEPH SYSs
       will fail, as this function will fail with an error.  To prevent this from coming
       as a surprise, however, when "last_SYS_<DATABASE>" gets somewhere near to the value
       stored in "maximum_SYS_<DATABASE>", a mail will be sent to the Admin with every
       SYS allocated, warning them that only N numbers remain free for the XY database.
       The number until MAX SYS which determines this period of warning emails is
       determined by a variable "warn_admin_at_N_sys_remaining".  It is set to 2000 by
       default, but can be changed.
       When the system allocates a new sys and there are 2000 or less free SYS remaining,
       the warning mails to ADMIN will be sent.

       @param alephdatabase: (string) the name of the ALEPH database for which a SYS is to be
        allocated.  E.g. "CER".  The he absence of this will cause the function to fail.
        Also, the absence of either of the 2 counter files "last_SYS_${database}" and
        "maximum_SYS_${database}" will cause the function to fail.
