    """
    Stamp certain files that have been uploaded during a submission.

    @param parameters: (dictionary) - must contain:

         + latex_template: (string) - the name of the LaTeX template that
            should be used for the creation of the stamp.

         + latex_template_vars: (string) - a string-ified dictionary
            of variables to be replaced in the LaTeX template and the
            values (or names of files in curdir containing the values)
            with which to replace them. Use prefix 'FILE:' to specify
            that the stamped value must be read from a file in
            submission directory instead of being a fixed value to
            stamp.
            E.G.:
               { 'TITLE' : 'FILE:DEMOTHESIS_TITLE',
                 'DATE'  : 'FILE:DEMOTHESIS_DATE'
               }

         + files_to_be_stamped: (string) - The directories in which files
            should be stamped: This is a comma-separated list of directory
            names. E.g.:
               DEMOTHESIS_MAIN,DEMOTHESIS_ADDITIONAL

            (If you use Create_Upload_Files_Interface function, you
            should know that uploaded files goes under a subdirectory
            'updated/' of the /files/ folder in submission directory:
            in this case you have to specify this component in the
            parameter. For eg:
            updated/DEMOTHESIS_MAIN,updated/DEMOTHESIS_ADDITIONAL)

         + stamp: (string) - the type of stamp to be applied to the files.
            should be one of:
              + first (only the first page is stamped);
              + all (all pages are stamped);
              + coverpage (a separate cover-page is added to the file as a
                 first page);

         + layer: (string) - the position of the stamp. Should be one of:
              + background (invisible if original file has a white -
                            not transparent- background layer)
              + foreground (on top of the stamped file. If the stamp
                            does not have a transparent background,
                            will hide all of the document layers)

         + switch_file: (string) - when this value is set, specifies
            the name of a file that will swith on/off the
            stamping. The 'switch_file' must contain the names defined
            in 'files_to_be_stamped' (comma-separated values). Stamp
            will be applied only to files referenced in the
            switch_file. No stamp is applied if the switch_file is
            missing from the submission directory.
            However if the no switch_file is defined in this variable
            (parameter is left empty), stamps are applied according
            the variable 'files_to_be_stamped'.
            Useful for eg. if you want to let your users control the
            stamping with a checkbox on your submission page.

    If all goes according to plan, for each directory in which files are to
    be stamped, the original, unstamped files should be found in a
    directory 'files_before_stamping/DIRNAME', and the stamped versions
    should be found under 'files/DIRNAME'. E.g., for DEMOTHESIS_Main:
         - Unstamped: files_before_stamping/DEMOTHESIS_Main
         - Stamped:   files/DEMOTHESIS_Main
