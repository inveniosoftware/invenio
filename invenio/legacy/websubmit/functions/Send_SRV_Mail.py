   ##             the document from its reference. This value might then
   ##             be used to derive the list of addresses
   ##             emailFile: name of the file in which the user's email is

    This function sends an email to warn people a revision has been
    carried out.

    Parameters:

       * notefile: name of the file in which the note can be found

       * emailfile: name of the file containing the submitter's email

       * addressesSRV: email addresses of the people who will receive
                       this email (comma separated list). this
                       parameter may contain the <CATEG> string. In
                       which case the variable computed from the
                       [categformatDAM] parameter replaces this
                       string.
                       eg.:"<CATEG>-email@cern.ch"

       * categformatDAM: contains a regular expression used to compute
                         the category of the document given the
                         reference of the document.

                         eg.: if [categformatAFP]="TEST-<CATEG>-.*"
                         and the reference of the document is
                         "TEST-CATEGORY1-2001-001", then the computed
                         category equals "CATEGORY1"
