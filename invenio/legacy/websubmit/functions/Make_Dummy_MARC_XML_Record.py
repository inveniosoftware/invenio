    Make a dummy MARC XML record and store it in a submission's working-
    directory.
    This dummy record is not intended to be inserted into the Invenio
    repository. Rather, it is intended as a way for other submission-
    related functionalities to have access to the data submitted without
    necessarily having to know the names of the files in which the
    values were stored.
    An example could be the publiline service: by using a dummy record
    in the submission's directory in would be able to access an item's
    information (e.g. title, etc) without having to know the name of the
    title file, etc.
    Another use for the dummy record could be, for example, creating a
    preview of the submitted record information with bibconvert.

    @param parameters: (dictionary) - must contain:

          + dummyrec_source_tpl: (string) - the name of the bibconvert
            source template used for the creation of the dummy record.

          + dummyrec_create_tpl: (string) - the name of the bibconvert
            create template used for the creation of the dummy record.

    @param curdir: (string) - the current submission's working
                              directory.

    @param form: (dictionary) - form fields.

    @param user_info: (dictionary) - various information about the
                                     submitting user (includes the
                                     apache req object).

    @return: (string) - empty string.

                        unexpected error is encountered.
