    @param categ_file_withd: (string) - some document types are
           separated into different categories, each of which has its own
           referee(s).
           In such document types, it's necessary to know the document-
           type's category in order to choose the referee.
           This parameter provides a means by which the category information
           can be extracted from a file in the current submission's working
           directory. It should therefore be a filename.

    @param categ_rnseek_withd: (string) - some document types are
           separated into different categories, each of which has its own
           referee(s).
           In such document types, it's necessary to know the document-
           type's category in order to choose the referee.
           This parameter provides a means by which the category information
           can be extracted from the document's reference number.
           It is infact a string that will be compiled into a regexp and
           an attempt will be made to match it agains the document's reference
           number starting from the left-most position.
           The only pre-requisite is that the segment in which the category is
           sought should be indicated with <CATEGORY>.
           Thus, an example might be as follows:
              ATL(-COM)?-<CATEGORY>-.+
           This would allow "PHYS" in the following reference number to be
           recognised as the category:
              ATL-COM-PHYS-2008-001
