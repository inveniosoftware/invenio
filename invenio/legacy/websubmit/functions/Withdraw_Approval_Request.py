    """
    This function is used in a "withdraw approval request" submission
    in order to register the withdral of the request in the WebSubmit
    "Approvals" DB (sbmAPPROVAL).
    At the time of the approval request withdrawal, the document could be
    in one of several different approval "states" and depending upon that
    state, the action taken by this function differs. The states are as
    follows:
          * Approval of the document has previously been requested and it is
            still in the "waiting" state.
             -> In this case, the status of the document in the sbmAPPROVAL
                table is set to "withdrawn".
          * Approval for the document has never been requested.
             -> In this case, there is nothing to do.
          * Approval of the document has previously been requested, but the
            document was rejected.
             -> In this case, it's too late to withdraw the approval request
                and there is nothing left to do.
          * Approval of the document has previously been requested and it has
            been approved.
             -> In this case, it's too late to withdraw the approval request
                and there is nothing left to do.
          * Approval of the document has previously been requested, but the
            request withdrawn.

    @param categ_file_withd: (string) - some document types are
           separated into different categories, each of which has its own
           referee(s).
           In such document types, it's necessary to know the document-
           type's category in order to choose the referee.
           This parameter provides a means by which the category information
           can be extracted from a file in the current submission's working
           directory. It should therefore be a filename.

    @param categ_rnseek_withd: (string) - some document types are
           separated into different categories, each of which has its own
           referee(s).
           In such document types, it's necessary to know the document-
           type's category in order to choose the referee.
           This parameter provides a means by which the category information
           can be extracted from the document's reference number.
           It is infact a string that will be compiled into a regexp and
           an attempt will be made to match it agains the document's reference
           number starting from the left-most position.
           The only pre-requisite is that the segment in which the category is
           sought should be indicated with <CATEGORY>.
           Thus, an example might be as follows:
              ATL(-COM)?-<CATEGORY>-.+
           This would allow "PHYS" in the following reference number to be
           recognised as the category:
              ATL-COM-PHYS-2008-001

    @return: (string) - a message for the user.

    @Exceptions raised: + InvenioWebSubmitFunctionStop when the submission
                          should be halted.

                          error has been encountered and execution cannot
