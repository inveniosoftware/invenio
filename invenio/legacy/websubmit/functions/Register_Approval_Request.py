    This function is used at the time of a "request for approval" submission
    in order to register the request in the WebSubmit "Approvals" DB
    (sbmAPPROVAL).
    At the time of approval request, the document could be in one of
    several different approval "states" and depending upon that state,
    the action taken by this function differs. The states are as
    follows:
          * Approval for the document has never been requested.
             -> In this case, a new row for the document is inserted into the
                approvals table with the "waiting" state.
          * Approval of the document has previously been requested and it is
            still in the "waiting" state.
             -> In this case, the date of last request for the document is
                updated in the approvals table.
          * Approval of the document has previously been requested, but the
            document was rejected.
             -> In this case, the function will halt the submission with a
                message informing the user that approval of the document was
                already rejected.
          * Approval of the document has previously been requested and it has
            been approved.
             -> In this case, the function will halt the submission with a
                message informing the user that the document has already
                been approved and that no further action is necessary.
          * Approval of the document has previously been requested, but the
            request withdrawn.
             -> In this case, the function will update the "approval status"
                of the document to "waiting" and will return a message
                informing the user that although the approval request was
                previously withdrawn, it has been requested again.

    @param categ_file_appreq: (string) - some document types are
           separated into different categories, each of which has its own
           referee(s).
           In such document types, it's necessary to know the document-
           type's category in order to choose the referee.
           This parameter provides a means by which the category information
           can be extracted from a file in the current submission's working
           directory. It should therefore be a filename.

    @param categ_rnseek_appreq: (string) - some document types are
           separated into different categories, each of which has its own
           referee(s).
           In such document types, it's necessary to know the document-
           type's category in order to choose the referee.
           This parameter provides a means by which the category information
           can be extracted from the document's reference number.
           It is infact a string that will be compiled into a regexp and
           an attempt will be made to match it agains the document's reference
           number starting from the left-most position.
           The only pre-requisite is that the segment in which the category is
           sought should be indicated with <CATEGORY>.
           Thus, an example might be as follows:
              ATL(-COM)?-<CATEGORY>-.+
           This would allow "PHYS" in the following reference number to be
           recognised as the category:
              ATL-COM-PHYS-2008-001

    @param note_file_appreq: (string) - the name of the file from which
           any "notes" to be added into the approval request's "note" field in
           the database are to be read. (File must be in the current submission's
           working directory.)

    @return: (string) - a message for the user.

    @Exceptions raised: + InvenioWebSubmitFunctionStop when the submission
                          should be halted.
                        + InvenioWebSubmitFunctionError when an unexpected
                          error has been encountered and execution cannot
