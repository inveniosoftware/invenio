    Run the plot extraction on the current record.

    The record ID (sysno) must be defined and known already, and the
    files attached already (so the function must be run after
    'Move_Uploaded_Files_To_Storage' & co., not after a FFT that could
    be scheduled later).

    @param parameters:(dictionary) - contains:

      + with_docname: run plot extraction only on files matching this
                    docname only. If the value starts with "file:", read
                    the docname value from the specified file.

      + with_doctype: run plot extraction only on files matching this
                    doctype only. If the value starts with "file:", read
                    the doctype value from the specified file.

      + with_docformat: run plot extraction only on files matching this
                      format only. If the value starts with "file:", read
                      the doctype value from the specified file.

      + extract_plots_switch_file: run plot extraction only if the filename
                                  exists in curdir. Typically one would set
                                  'files' to extract plots only if some files
                                  have been uploaded.

    If none of the with_* parameters is provided, the current plot
    extractor behaviour will not lead to extracting the plots from all
    the files, but will fall back on 'arXiv' source extraction (see
    plotextractor for details).
