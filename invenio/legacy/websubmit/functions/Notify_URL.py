    Access a given URL, and possibly post some content.

    Could be used to notify that a record has been fully integrated.
    (the URL is only accessed once the BibTask created by this
    function runs in BibSched, not the when the function is run. The
    BibTask uses a task sequence ID to respect ordering of tasks)

    if URL is empty, skip the notification.

    @param parameters: (dictionary) - contains the following parameter
         strings used by this function:

         + url: (string) - the URL to be contacted by this function
                           (must start with http/https)

                           the URL in a file on curdir with the given name.
                           for eg: "FILE:my_url"
                           (value retrieved when function is run)

         + data: (string) - (optional) the data to be posted at the
                            given URL.  if no value is given, the URL
                            will be accessed via GET.

                            the data in a file on curdir with the given name.

                                    to post data. Default is 'text/plain'.
                                    Ignored if not data is posted.

                                    values) to contact in case the URL
                                    cannot be accessed after all attempts.
