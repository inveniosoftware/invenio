## FIXME: Session locking is currently disabled because, since it's
## implementing the mod_python technique of using Apache mutexes, these
## are by default a very limited resources (according to
## <http://www.modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/inst-apacheconfig.html#l2h-21>)
## only 8 mutexes are available by default)
## Since the session would be locked at constructor time and unlocked at
## destructor time, and since we cache the session for the whole request
## handling time, enabling locking would mean that at most only 8 requests
## could been handled at the same time. This is quite limited and, anyway
## there's already local locking available thanks to our MySQL backend.
