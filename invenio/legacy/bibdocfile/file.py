raise ImportError, """file.py module of Invenio has been superseeded by bibdocfile.py.
In order to port your code to the new bibdocfile note that:
    * the methods have been renamed from camelCode to underscore_standard
    * addFilesNewVersion and addFilesNewFormat are now singular:
        i.e. add_file_new_version and add_file_new_format. You will have
        to call them each time for every single file.
    * docnames are used everywhere in place of docids
