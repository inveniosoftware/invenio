<h2><a name="shortIntro">1. Overview</a></h2>
<p>The BibKnowledge module provides tools for cataloguers to manage "knowledge bases", "authority files", 
and "ontologies". BibKnowledge contains information for standardisation and record quality checking. 
Typical examples: (1) field author institute is often written as "Odd University Strange Research Lab" 
though it is officially (canonically) known as "StrangeLab of the Odd University". 
(2) If field "author email" contains "@strange.odd.edu" the author institute should be 
"StrangeLab of the Odd University". (3) Ontology files contain information about the hierarchy
of key words.

<p>
There are three four types of knowledge bases 
<ul>
<li>  "map_from" "map_to": this is the typical case, the knowledge base is essentially 
a list of left side - right side pairs, like Genf -> Geneva 
or "Odd University Strange Research Lab" -> "StrangeLab of the Odd University". 
The abbreviation for this type is kbr (for reference).
<li> "authority only": this kind of knowledge base only lists the canonical values. 
Example: "Geneva", "StrangeLab of the Odd University". 
It is a special case of "map_from" "map_to", where left side and right side are identical. 
The abbreviation for this type is kba (for authority).
<li> dynamic: these knowledge bases are "authority only" knowledge bases that are built
dynamically using a search expression. Example: if the author institute is stored in
field 100__u, a dynamic knowledge base that uses this field, returns all the values 
of 100__u. The abbreviation for this type is kbd (for dynamic).
<li>taxonomy (or ontology): an RDF (resource description framework) 
file can be uploaded into invenio and used as a knowledge base. 
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="admin">2. Configure Knowledge Bases</a></h2>
<h3><a name="addKB">2.1 Add a Knowledge Base</a></h3>
<p>To add a knowledge base go to the <a href="/kb">Manage Knowledge Bases</a> administration page. Three types of knowledge bases can be added: "map_from" "map_to" by the "Add New Knowledge Base" button, dynamic by the "Add a dynamic KB" button and a taxonomy by the "Add new Taxonomy" button.</br> 
    After the knowledge base has been created you will be asked to fill in its attribute. See <a href="#attrsKB">Edit the Attributes of a Knowledge Base</a> to learn more about the attributes of knowledge bases.</p>

<h3><a name="removeKB">2.2 Remove a Knowledge Base</a></h3>
    <p>To remove a knowledge base go to the <a href="/kb">Manage Knowledge Bases</a> administration page. Click on the "Delete" button facing the knowledge base you want to remove and confim. The knowledge base and all the mapping it includes are removed.</p>

<h3><a name="addMappingKB">2.3 Add a Mapping</a></h3>
    <p>Go to the <a href="/kb">Manage Knowledge Bases</a> administration page and click on the knowledge base for which you want to add a mapping. Fill in the form of the "Add New Mapping" section on the left of the page with the new mapping, and click on "Add New Mapping". The mapping has been created. Alternatively you can create the mapping without its attributes, and fill them afterward (See <a href="#editMappingKB">Edit a Mapping</a>).<p/>

<h3><a name="removeMappingKB">2.4 Remove a Mapping</a></h3>
    <p>Go to the <a href="/kb">Manage Knowledge Bases</a> administration page and click on the knowledge base for which you want to remove a mapping. Click on the "Delete" button facing the mapping you want to delete.

<h3><a name="editMappingKB">2.5 Edit a Mapping</a></h3>
    <p>Go to the <a href="/kb">Manage Knowledge Bases</a> administration page and click on the knowledge base for which you want to edit a mapping. Locate the mapping in the list. You can click on the column headers to order the list by <i>Map From</i> or by <i>Map To</i> to help you find it. Once you have edited the mapping click on the corresponding "Save" button.

<h3><a name="attrsKB">2.6 Edit the Attributes of a Knowledge Base</a></h3>
    Go to the <a href="/kb">Manage Knowledge Bases</a> administration page and click on the knowledge base you want to edit. In the top menu, click on "Knowledge Base Attributes". You can then give your knowledge base a name and a description. Finally click on the "Update Base Attributes" button.
