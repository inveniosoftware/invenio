This is turned into a 2-tuple. The first entry in the tuple is a
Python dictionary containing the submission info. The second entry is
the trailing text that follows the submission (the submission MUST be
at the top of the text).

It is fairly robust when treating misformatted submissions, so should
hopefully protect against misformatting due to evil smtp servers /
conversion from HTML email producing clients, etc. For example, we can
process the following OK:
