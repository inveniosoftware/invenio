<a name="1"></a><h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p>BibCirculation enables you to manage the circulation of books (and other
items) in a traditional library. BibCirculation has 2 sides: the user (borrower)
interface and the admin (librarian) interface. In order to being able to use the
librarian interface you need to have the correspondent rights as Invenio user.
</p>

<p>If you have rights to run BibCirculation, click on the "Administration"
tab and select "Run Bibcirculation". You will see the so called "main menu",
that will be present almost in every page in the librarian interface.
</p>

<a name="2"></a><h2>2. Items</h2>

<p>The first you need to circulate books are books. "Item" refers to anything
that can have a barcode. In the case of books, an item is a copy of a book. The
first thing you need is adding copies to the system. If you already have
digitalized data about your copies, it is recommended to write a script to add
the copies to the database. Otherwise, you need to add them one by one.
To do this, search the book record in Invenio, go to the 'Detailed record' view,
then the 'Holdings' tab. If you have BibCirculation rights, you will see a link.
This link will let you add the first copy for that record (in case it has none)
or it will take you to the record details in the librarian interface (in case it
already has copies) where you can find a "Add new copy" button.</p>

<p>You can get to the "Item details" page clicking in the book title link that
can be found in many places around the module. You can also get to this page
by searching a record using the "Items" in the main menu. In the "Item details"
page the actions and the information diplayed will be different fot Periodicals
and other records.</p>
