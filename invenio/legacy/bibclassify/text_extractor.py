"""
BibClassify text extractor.

This module provides method to extract the fulltext from local or remote
documents. Currently 2 formats of documents are supported: PDF and text
documents.

2 methods provide the functionality of the module: text_lines_from_local_file
and text_lines_from_url.

This module also provides the utility 'is_pdf' that uses GNU file in order to
determine if a local file is a PDF file.

This module is STANDALONE safe
