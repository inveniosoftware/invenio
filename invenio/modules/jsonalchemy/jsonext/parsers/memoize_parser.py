    Handle the ``@memoze`` decorator.

    .. code-block:: ini

        number_of_comments:
            calculated:
                @memoize(300)
                get_number_of_comments(self['recid'])

    This decorator works only with calculated fields and it has three different
    ways of doing it:

    1. No decorator is specified, the value of the field will be calculated
       every time that somebody asks for it and its value will not be stored
       in the DB. This way is useful to create fields that return objects
       that can't be stored in the DB in a JSON friendly manner or a field
       that changes a lot its value and the calculated function is really
       light.

    2. The decorator is used without any time, ``@memoize()``. This means
       that the value of the field is calculated when the record is created,
       it is stored in the DB and it is the job of the client that modifies
       the data, which is used to calculated the field, to update the field
       value in the DB.
       This way should be used for fields that are typically updated just by
       a few clients, like ``bibupload``, ``bibrank``, etc.

    3. A lifetime is set with the decorator ``@memoize(300)``. In this case
       the field value is only calculated when somebody asks for it and its
       value is stored in a general cache (``invenio.ext.cache``) using the
       timeout from the decorator.
       This form of the memoize decorator should be used with a field that
       changes a lot its value and the function to calculate it is not
       light.
       Keep in mind that the value that someone might get could be
       outdated. To avoid this situation the client that modifies the data
       where the value is calculated from could also invalidate the cache or
       modify the cached value.
       One good example of the use of it is the field ``number_of_comments``

    The cache engine used by this decorator could be set using
    ``CFG_JSONALCHEMY_CACHE`` in your instance configuration, by default
    ``invenio.ext.cache:cache`` will use.
    ``CFG_JSONALCHEMY_CACHE`` must be and importable string pointing to the
    cache object.
