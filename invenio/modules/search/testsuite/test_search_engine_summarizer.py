"""Unit tests for the search engine summarizer."""

# Note: citation summary tests were moved to BibRank as part of the
# self-cite commit 1fcbed0ec34a9c31f8a727e21890c529d8222256.  Keeping
# this file here with empty test case set in order to overwrite any
# previously installed file.  Also, keeping TEST_SUITE empty so that
# `inveniocfg --run-unit-tests' would not complain.
