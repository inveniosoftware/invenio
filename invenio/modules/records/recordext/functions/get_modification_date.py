    # WARNING: HACK/FIXME
    #
    # When bibupload inserts/updates records it sets hstRECORD.job_date=t1 and
    # bibfmt.last_updated=t1 and bibrec.modification_date=t2 (with t2 > t1).
    # This is intended behaviour in master (see ticket #1431).
    #
    # Revision verifier checks 005 on upload against hstRECORD.job_date
    # (i.e. t1).
    #
    # JSONAlchemy was getting modification_date/005 from
    # bibrec.modification_date (i.e. t2).
    #
    # Thus if you did a get_record, and tried to reupload the file, the XML
    # woudl have t2 in 005, which revision verifier would reject since it
    # compares against t1.
    #
    # Modification date ought to be taken from bibrec.modification_date and all
    # three timestamps ought to be the same. Thus below is a hack, that ought
    # to be fixed in bibupload instead. Unfortunately so much other code is
    # might rely on the current behaviour that it's hard to change.
