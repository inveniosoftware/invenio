    invenio.modules.uploader.workflows
    ----------------------------------

    Every uploader workflow should be a python dictionary contain three keys:

    * `pre_trasks`
        list of tasks which will be run before running the actual
        workflow, each element of the list should a callable.

    * `tasks`
        List of tasks to be run by the `WorkflowEngine`.

    * `post_tasks`
        Same as for `pre_tasks` but in this case they will be run
        after the workflow is done.

    An example function to be called after the workflow could be::

        def return_recids_only(records, **kwargs):
            records = [obj[1].get('recid') for obj in records]


    This functions must have always the same parameters (like the one above) and
    those parameters have the value that
    :func:`~invenio.modules.uploader.tasks.run_workflow` gets.
