invenio.modules.annotations
---------------------------

**FIXME: Outdated documentation.**

To enable the module, make sure to remove it from ``PACKAGES_EXCLUDE``,
where it is placed by default.

To enable Web page annotations, add the following to your templates:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {%- from "annotations/macros.html" import annotations_toolbar  -%}

    {%- block global_bundles -%}
      {{ super() }}
      {% bundle "30-annotations.js", "30-annotations.css" %}
    {%- endblock global_javascript -%}

    {%- block page_body -%}
      {{ annotations_toolbar() }}
      {{ super() }}
    {%- endblock page_body -%}

To enable document annotations, along with the previewer, set the following
configuration variables to ``True``:

.. code-block:: python

    ANNOTATIONS_NOTES_ENABLED = True
    ANNOTATIONS_PREVIEW_ENABLED = True
