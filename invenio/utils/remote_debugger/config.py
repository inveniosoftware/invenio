# configuration options for Eclipse/Pydev

# Remote debugging with Eclipse Pydev - Apache does not need to be configured
# as a single-worker. But you do the following:
#
# 1. find pydevd.py inside your Eclipse/Pydev installation
#    (on my computer it is in: c:\dev\eclipse342\plugins\org.python.pydev.debug_1.5.0.1251989166\pysrc)
# 2. copy the pysrc folder into the remote machine (eg. inside: /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages
# 3. rename the pysrc into pydev
# 4. put __init__.py inside pydev (if you don't do that, pydev is not recognized as a package)
#
# Then, in your Eclipse, change perspective to the debug mode, start Pydev remote
# debug server, set some breakpoint and reload a webpage with url param debug=3
# eg. http://invenio-vm/?debug=3
#
# I repeat, you must be in the Debug perspective to catch the breakpoints!
#
# This is where your (local) Eclipse is listening for communication, this IP address
# can be anything that Invenio can access (ie. the machine that is running Invenio
# must have access to the IP)

# When you hit a breakpoing, Eclipse needs to know which file to display. For instance:
# you are developing inside a virtual machine (Linux) where Invenio code lives at
# /opt/cds-invenio/lib/python/invenio. Your environment is Windows (yes, why not? ;-))
# and you have access to the invenio folder through samba as:
#
# \\invenio-vm\root\opt\cds-invenio\lib\python\invenio
#
# (or perhaps you don't have samba but you have a local copy of the codebase somewhere else)
#
# You must set a mapping: local Eclipse path <--> remote Linux path
# in this way:
#
# CFG_REMOTE_DEBUGGER_PYDEV_PATHS = [('\\\\invenio-vm\\root\\opt\\cds-invenio\\lib\\python\\invenio',
#                                     '/opt/cds-invenio/lib/python/invenio')]
#
# what I (rca) do is to map a whole drive through samba:
# CFG_REMOTE_DEBUGGER_PYDEV_PATHS = [('\\\\invenio-vm\\root\\',
#                                     '/')]
# and I also recommend using (back)slashes at the end, ie. /opt/ and not /opt

CFG_REMOTE_DEBUGGER_PYDEV_PATHS = [
    #('/opt/cds-invenio/lib/python/invenio/', '/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/invenio/'),
