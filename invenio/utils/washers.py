    Content is a dictionary containing the field names as a
    key, and a tuple (type, default) as value.

    'type' can be list, unicode, invenio.legacy.wsgi.utils.StringField, int,
    tuple, or invenio.legacy.wsgi.utils.Field (for file uploads).

    The specification automatically includes the 'ln' field, which is
    common to all queries.

    Arguments that are not defined in 'content' are discarded.

    .. note::

        In case `list` or `tuple` were asked for, we assume that
        `list` or `tuple` of strings is to be returned.  Therefore beware when
        you want to use ``wash_urlargd()`` for multiple file upload forms.
