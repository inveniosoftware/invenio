    Takes a typical mail quoted text, e.g.::
        hello,
        you told me:
        >> Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries
        I must tell you that I'm not convinced. Then in this discussion:
        >>>> Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
        >> No. Now, go away, or I shall taunt you a second time-a!
        I think we're not going to be friends!

    and return an html formatted output, e.g.::
        hello,<br/>
        you told me:<br/>
        <div>
          Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries

        I must tell you that I'm not convinced. Then in this discussion:
        <div>
          <div>
            Is there someone else up there we could talk to?

    The behaviour is different when C{indent_block} is C{True} or C{False}.
    When C{True} the when C{indent_html} is only added at each change of
    level of indentation, while it is added for each line when C{False}.
    For eg::
        >> a
        >> b
        >>>> c

    would result in (if C{True})::
        <div class="commentbox">
            a<br/>
            b<br/>
            <div class="commentbox">
                c<br/>
            </div>
        </div>

    or would be (if C{False})::
        <div class="commentbox"> a</div><br/>
        <div class="commentbox"> b</div><br/>
        <div class="commentbox"><div class="commentbox"> c</div></div><br/>
