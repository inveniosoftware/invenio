2. Detailed instructions for the patient CDS Invenio admin
===================================================

      $ cd /usr/local/src/cds-invenio-0.90

          Change to the directory where you have configured and built
          the CDS Invenio.

      $ make uninstall     ## NOTE: This has not been tested yet!!

          This will uninstall all the installed web pages, binary
          scripts and database utilities from their respective
          directories.

          Note that it may happen that you will need to clean manually
          some directories and files that may have been added under
          @prefix@.

      $ cd ..

          Go to the parent directory.

      $ rm -rf cds-invenio-0.90.tar.gz cds-invenio-0.90

          Wipe out the downloaded tarball and all the CDS Invenio sources.

      $ mysql -h sqlserver.domain.com -u root -p mysql
          mysql> DROP DATABASE cdsinvenio;
          mysql> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON cdsinvenio.* FROM cdsinvenio@webserver.domain.com;

          Ask your MySQL administrator to execute the above commands
          to drop CDS Invenio databases and to revoke access rights
          from the CDS Invenio user.

Thanks for testing CDS Invenio.  We would be glad to hear from you
